How much has changed since 2016, when the U.S. experienced unprecedented attacks on its election infrastructure?  What has to happen to ensure that the 2020 presidential election is secure?  In this talk, I'll give a progress report on election security in the U.S. and around the world, informed by results from my own research and my work with legislators and election officials over the past two years.  I'll also hold a mock election with a current U.S. voting machine to demonstrate how cyberattacks on election infrastructure could potentially change the results of national elections.  Finally, I'll explain what everyone can do to get involved and help safeguard the foundations of democracy.\r\n","description":"Strengthening election cybersecurity is essential for safeguarding democracy. For over 15 years, I and other computer scientists have been warning about the vulnerable state of election security, but attacks against recent elections in the U.S. and Europe demonstrate that sophisticated attackers are becoming more aggressive, even as campaigning and voting become increasingly reliant on computers.\r\n \r\nSince 2016, I’ve been working with election officials and members of congress to strengthen election cybersecurity.  In this talk, I’ll give a progress report about what’s happened since then and what still needs to happen to secure future elections.  While many U.S. states have made progress at securing some aspects of their election infrastructure, and Congress provided $380M in new funding to the strengthen elections, significant vulnerabilities remain that put the integrity of future elections at risk.  To demonstrate the ongoing threat, I’ll hold a mock election on stage with a real U.S. voting machine still used in 18 states, and show how remote attacks could potentially affect the outcome of a close national contest.\r\n \r\nFinally, I’ll explain how defenses developed by researchers over the past decade could provide practical and cost-effective safeguards.  Unfortunately, they have yet to be widely deployed due to a lack of resources and political leadership.  I’ll describe legislative efforts in the U.S. and other countries that could, if successful, go a long way to making elections secure.  I’ll also explain what technologists and other concerned humans can do to help secure elections at all levels.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":4228,"public_name":"J.

But at the same time, these systems are pervasively prone to security flaws and subject to malicious attacks.  We have to trust them, but they are not *trustworthy*.\r\n\r\nThere are two root causes. First, the pan-industry computing infrastructure, of processors, programming languages, and operating systems, is based on designs from a more forgiving time, with simpler systems and little incentive to design-in strong security protection. Second, the conventional engineering techniques we use (prose specifications, manually written tests, and test-and-debug development) are good enough to make systems work in common cases, but cannot exclude all errors - and a single coding error can lead to a devastating exploit.\r\n\r\nAre we doomed?  Perhaps not.  This talk will highlight the sorry state of the art and then draw on cutting-edge research, from the University of Cambridge, SRI International, ARM, and other partners, to show some ways we can do better.  First, we'll show how it's become possible to build and use rigorous models for key existing interfaces to improve engineering: for the ARMv8-A and RISC-V architectures, and the C language, in the <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/\">REMS</a> project.

From the vulnerabilities that created the need of a new TLS version to the challenges of deploying it due to broken devices this talk will give an overview of the new TLS 1.3.","description":"In August the new version 1.3 of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol was released. It‘s the result of a process that started over four years ago when it became increasingly clear that previous TLS versions suffered from some major weaknesses.\r\n\r\nIn many ways TLS 1.3 is the biggest step ever done in the history of TLS and its predecessor SSL. While previous TLS versions always tried to retain compatibility and not change too many things, the new version radically removes problematic and insecure constructions like static RSA key exchanges, fragile CBC/HMAC constructions and broken hash functions like MD5 and SHA1.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus TLS 1.3 comes with a reworked handshake that reduces the number of round-trips and thus provides not just more security, but also better performance. If that sounds too good to be true: An optional, even faster mode of TLS 1.3 – the zero round trip or 0RTT mode – makes some security researchers worried, because they fear it introduces new security risks due to replay attacks.\r\n\r\nThough the road to TLS 1.3 was complicated. The Internet is a buggy place and particularly Enterprise devices of all kinds – middleboxes, TLS-terminating servers and TLS-interception devices – slowed down the deployment and finalization of the new encryption protocol. Also some banks thought that TLS 1.3 is too secure for them.\r\n\r\nThe talk will give an overview of the developments that led to TLS 1.3, the major changes it brings, the challenges it had to face and some practical advice for deployment.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":2462,"public_name":"hanno"}],"links":[{"url":"https://www.feistyduck.com/bulletproof-tls-newsletter/issue_44_tls_1_3_is_here","title":"TLS 1.3 is here"},{"url":"https://www.feistyduck.com/bulletproof-tls-newsletter/issue_33_why_tls_13_isnt_there_yet","title":"Why TLS 1.3 isn’t there yet"},{"url":"https://www.golem.de/news/tls-1-3-die-zukunft-der-netzverschluesselung-1612-124724.html","title":"TLS 1.3: Die Zukunft der Netzverschlüsselung"},{"url":"https://int21.de/slides/35c3-tls13/","title":"The Rocky Road to TLS 1.3 - Slides"}],"attachments":[{"url":"/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/003/732/original/tls13.pdf?1546421079","title":"Slides"}]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9904.html","id":9904,"guid":"d995955c-319f-4228-b3f4-080868bbfdf8","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-27T12:50:00+01:00","start":"12:50","duration":"01:00","room":"Borg","slug":"35c3-9904-the_social_credit_system","title":"\"The\" Social Credit System","subtitle":"Why It's Both Better and Worse Than We can Imagine","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"The Chinese Social Credit System (SCS) has been discussed a lot in Western media. However, we do not know currently how the system that is supposed to take nationwide effect by 2020 will look like, as there are more than 70 pilot projects currently undertaken. These pilots rank from commercial royalty and rewards programs (Sesame Credit) to an Orwellian system, where each action has a predetermined associated score (Rongcheng). In-between, there’s nebulous algorithmic systems that basically act as a Black Box (Honesty Shanghai). This talk, therefore, looks at some of these pilots and their implementation details, and through an agent-based modeling framework, discusses the likely effects of different implementations. In doing so, it shows that most of the systems currently being tested are prone to manipulation by leaders from all levels of government, and that the ostensible goal of allocating scarce resources more efficiently is unlikely to be served by the new system(s).","description":"The author, Antonia Hmaidi, is a PhD candidate in East Asian Economics with a focus on China.

Censored Planet use tens of thousands of *remote infrastructural and organizational vantage points* from over 170 countries to conduct it’s measurements, thereby removing the need for user participation. This allows us to regularly measure Internet disruptions over a longer period of time in significantly more countries in a safer way. \r\n\r\nThe research we conduct at Censored Planet provides unique insights and data points on Internet disruptions.

In simple terms and without too much technical detail we'll start out with the \"atom\" of networks <i>the packet</i>, then cover the fundamental <i>Internet Protocol</i> (IPv4-only for simplicity), we'll try to answer <i>what is a network?</i> - not obvious it turns out, we'll look at <i>where do IP addresses come from?</i> and then we'll move on to the Internet cornerstone that is <i>routing</i>. We'll approach routing from the perhaps most well-known router - the <i>wireless home router</i> - and then look at how similar or dissimilar <i>routers on the Internet</i> are to that home router, leading us to a look at the <i>routing protocol</i> which constantly determines how our packets flow throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThose are the basic building blocks of the Internet.

Many traders, hedge funds, ICOs and blockchain projects store the entirety of their cryptocurrency on one or very few wallets.

Moreover, many users that trade and speculate in cryptocurrency interact, update, and generate transactions using their hardware wallets on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we look at the good, the bad and the ugly of hardware wallet security: We will walk through the different architectures of the wallets, look at the different attack vectors and talk about the challenges of building secure hardware before diving in deep finding vulnerabilities in the different wallets.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities we will present range from vulnerabilities that can be fixed in a firmware upgrade, to bugs that will require a new hardware revision, up to attacks on the microcontrollers themselves, requiring new silicon to be fixed.\r\n\r\nSome of the (most entertaining) vulnerabilities will be demonstrated live on stage.\r\n\r\n<h2>Classes of Vulnerabilities we will look at</h2>\r\n<b>Firmware Vulnerabilities</b>\r\nFirmware vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities affecting the software that runs on the hardware wallet.

November 2011 enttarnte sich der „Nationalsozialistische Untergrund“ (NSU) selbst. Fast sieben Jahre später, am 10. Juli 2018, wurde das Urteil im ersten NSU-Prozess  gesprochen. Heute, fünf Monate nach der von Neonazis bejubelten mündlichen Urteilsverkündung, müssen wir mit einem Urteil umgehen, in dem sich viele gebrochene Aufklärungsversprechen zuspitzen.

Nach allem, was in den letzten Jahren – teilweise mühsam – über den NSU-Komplex ans Licht gezerrt werden konnte, ist die „Trio“-These aber nicht haltbar.

We also worked on our now open source framework to create and diassemble microcode for AMD CPUs up to 2013. We will give a short intro into how to use it to create custom microcode programs and test them on real hardware. We also provide guidelines on how to construct the test setup we used, which is essentially any old AMD mainboard (native serial port required), a RaspberryPi with a serial adapter and some wiring including a few basic electronic components.

Our talk will reveal such a campaign successfully executed by the Sednit group. This APT group, also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy and APT28, has been linked to numerous high profile cyberattacks such as the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak scandal.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, there was a public report stating that the infamous Sednit/Sofacy/APT28 APT group successfully trojanized a userland LoJack agent and used it against their targets. LoJack, an embedded anti-theft application, was scrutinized by security researchers in the past because of its unusual persistence method: a module preinstalled in many computers' UEFI/BIOS software. Over the years, several security risks have been found in this product, but no significant in-the-wild activity was ever reported until the discovery of the Sednit group leveraging some of the vulnerabilities affecting the userland agent. However, through our research, we now know that Sednit did not stop there: they also tried to, and succeeded, in installing a custom UEFI module directly into a system's SPI flash memory.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will detail the full infection chain showing how Sednit was able to install their custom UEFI module on key targets' computers.

Über deren nationale Koordinierungszentren wird Frontex über alle wichtigen Vorkommnisse an den Außengrenzen der Europäischen Union unterrichtet. Kern des EUROSUR-Systems ist die Satellitenaufklärung, über die Frontex auch selbst an den Grenzen beobachten kann. Die Bilder stammen von kommerziellen Satellitendiensten sowie von optischen und radarbasierten Satelliten des EU-Erdbeobachtungsprogramms „Copernicus“. Sie werden vom Satellitenzentrum der Europäischen Union (SatCen) erhoben, aufbereitet und an Frontex übermittelt. Zu den Bildlieferanten gehört der Rüstungskonzern Airbus, der Bilder seiner Radarsatelliten „TerraSar-X“ und „TanDEM-X“ mit einer Auflösung von 24 cm verkauft. Für die schnelle Kommunikation mit den Satelliten nutzt „Copernicus“ als erster Kunde die „Weltraumdatenautobahn“ des Airbus-Konzerns. Die Nutzung der Daten für die einzelnen AnwenderInnen wurde erst kürzlich mithilfe einer App vereinfacht, die ein Mitarbeiter der Abteilung „Informationshoheit“ als eine Art Instagram für Sicherheitsanwendungen beschreibt.\r\nNun werden auch die technischen Fähigkeiten von „Copernicus“ ausgebaut. Das System soll „Unregelmäßigkeiten im Schiffsverhalten“ erkennen und melden. Dabei werden Informationen zum Standort, der Schiffsbezeichnung und zum abweichenden Verhalten übermittelt. Als verdächtig kann etwa gelten, wenn ein Schiff keine gewöhnlichen Routen fährt oder die Geschwindigkeit verlangsamt. Frontex hat im vergangenen Jahr einen „Mehrzweck-Flugdienst“ gestartet. Von Flugzeugen über dem Mittelmeer aufgenommene Videos werden in Echtzeit in ein Lagezentrum der EUROSUR-Zentrale nach Warschau gestreamt. Seit diesem Jahr erhält Frontex außerdem Bilder von Aufklärungsdrohnen, die von der Agentur für die Sicherheit des Seeverkehrs geflogen werden. Zunächst handelt es sich dabei um ein Pilotprojekt für zwei verschieden große Drohnen der MALE-Klasse. Demnächst will Frontex außerdem Fesselballons zur „Grenzraumüberwachung aus der Luft“ testen. \r\n\r\n","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":4722,"public_name":"Matthias Monroy"}],"links":[],"attachments":[{"url":"/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/003/538/original/EUROSUR-Pilot.jpg?1539592021","title":" EUROSUR-Pilotprojekt von 2009.

The last decades of environmental research, however, made it evidently clear that anthropogenic impacts on the global ecology could lead to a sixth global extinction. Being caused by the destabilization of ecosystems due to climate change, poaching, fragmenting of habitats, species invasions, pollution and other human activities, this extinction event would be the first induced by a species and not by natural catastrophes.\r\n\r\nTwo general paths of action seem available to mitigate this threat or at least limit the damage: One consists of radically limiting anthropogenic influence on nature by restricting human habitats (to, as argued by E. O. Wilson among others, half of the earths surface), which, however, seems politically infeasible. A second strategy aims to effectively re-stabilize ecosystems by selective and specific intervention, but this would require a much deeper knowledge of ecosystem processes and how to modulate them. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will provide an overview of the declining quality of ecosystems worldwide and argue that data-driven approaches as well as a hacker mindset will be essential to tackle open questions.

If there is anything we learned from this research, it's that DPRK state-sponsored software is a secretive industry underlied by incredibly shady practices, and that if Kim Jong-Un sends you a free trial of his latest security solution, the correct answer is \"thank you but no thank you\".\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No significant knowledge in reverse engineering is required to understand the talk.

As an alternative to the large corporate social networks it enables autonomy for the users and a free zone from big data harvesting. \r\n\r\nIt’s based on a protocol (referred to as SSB) which connects the users via a blockchain styled base with each user functioning as a node. Since the information is collected via a 2 or 3 step social connection it’s completely usable while offline and syncs when connected to a local network, a friend or wifi.\r\n\r\nScuttlebutt has a large community of users who together develop the protocol and platforms. Completely open-source there are many initiatives of projects, maintenance and explorations as part of the Scuttlebutt ecosystem. Some of these projects range from local community on-boarding by @luandro in Quilombola - Brazil, git-ssb by @cel, and even a chess interface!\r\n\r\nAs the Scuttlebutt interface is interchangeable, with the one most widely used being Patchwork, there is a possibility to utilize the same network with multiple applications. Perfect for local communities in rural areas or for environments which require offline workability or simply for user with integrity, the potentials are grand. As of today the estimate is that the user base is beyond 8000 individuals, yet there's no way to surely know.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the Scuttleverse and beyond.

How they realise all this computation using very unreliable components is still largely an open question. Instead of transistors they have to employ proteins, but proteins constantly degenerate and are re-built making their numbers fluctuate. If cellular signalling is impaired severe diseases can be the result, for instance cancer or epilepsy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As cellular communication is so pervasive and essential, researchers start to look into this information flow in biological systems in more detail. My research group at the BioQuant centre, Heidelberg University, is also active in this area, an area which I would call Information Biology &mdash; the study of how biological systems deal with information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will show you how you can apply Shannon's information theory to biological systems. For this we need three ingredients, namely dynamic models of biological pathways, stochastic simulation algorithms (that take into account intrinsic fluctuations in molecular numbers), and, of course, Shannon's theory of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will give brief and user-friendly introductions to these three ingredients. After that I am going to talk about a number of use cases, such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How much memory does a bacterium have? And how long can it remember things?</li>\r\n<li>How many bits per second can a liver cell process via its calcium signalling pathway?</li>\r\n<li>How must signalling pathways be constructed, structurally and dynamically, for certain stimuli to be decoded?</li>\r\n<li>and others&hellip;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I will also give links to (open source) software that is being developed in my group, which you can use to simulate and play around with biochemical pathways, and also to estimate information flows and do information biology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FYI: The research I am talking about here is part of a research area which is called Computational Systems Biology. Systems Biology is a field which studies biological systems not by reducing them to their constituent parts, such as single receptors, genes, molecular complexes etc., but by viewing them in the cellular or organismal context and, importantly, as (dynamic) systems. And Computational Systems Biology is Systems Biology done with the help of mathematical models and simulation/analysis algorithms.</p>","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8521,"public_name":"Jürgen Pahle"}],"links":[{"url":"https://lab.pahle.org","title":"Research group homepage"}],"attachments":[{"url":"/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/003/676/original/2018-12-27_35C3JuergenPahle.pdf?1546000267","title":"Slides"}]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/10009.html","id":10009,"guid":"4dcbb9c4-8f93-40ed-85c0-90474f4ea623","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/010/009/large/AFROROUTES__-_TEDx-_Praia_2018_%28Auszug%29.001.jpeg?1542300758","date":"2018-12-27T18:10:00+01:00","start":"18:10","duration":"00:40","room":"Eliza","slug":"35c3-10009-afroroutes_africa_elsewhere","title":"Afroroutes: Africa Elsewhere","subtitle":"VR experience \"Beyond Slavery\"","track":"Art & Culture","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Let's think \"Beyond Slavery\": Afroroutes is a one-of-a-kind VR experience conceived as a journey through 3 displaced African heritages, immersing users in Rituals and Ceremonies to experience that well-conserved memory form, but also to feel the power of Music as a strong anthropological tool.

From Salvador to Bahia to Gujarat through Tangier, there is a common history. Based on this VR Experience, the debate should be extended around \"Beyond Slavery\".\r\n\r\nWhat happened with the millions of displaced African men and women? Where are their descendants living today? Did their original culture and language disappear? How did their heritage contribute to building their new countries? How did the assimilation or rejection process go? How has this memory subsisted, and how is it lived and celebrated today?  But also, how to assimilate that chapter of history and transform it into a real global narrative - is there what we call a \"diasporic identity\"? And if it is the case, how to build this identity within a global, disrupted world? How can digital tools push this storytelling process?  \r\n\r\nThe medium \"Virtual Reality\" takes all its sense in this project, allowing an immersive and almost physical experience of those paths of slavery. This experience is triggered by music and sounds. Music is much more than a simple way of being together: it is the oral legacy of our intertwined culture.

It is based on an extensive year-long study involving network measurements and interviews with key players. Crimea has become a \"laboratory\" where we can observe, in just 4 years, a rapid and profound transition of infrastructure, that deeply impacted the Internet Service Provider market, routing trajectories, Internet censorship practices in the region. Annexation has transformed the way Crimea is plugged to the \"outer world\" - in terms of peering and transit relations between various autonomous systems, creating a much more centralized infrastructure and monopolized market. This, in its turn, had an important impact for Crimean end-users - in terms of quality, speed, price of Internet service, as well as in terms of Internet censorship and various traffic anomalies that they experience. Moreover, server-side geoblocking by online payment platforms, Google Play, Apple and other important services, is imposed on Crimean users, because of international sanctions that have a controversial impact, including a risk of overblocking, further isolation of Crimean civil society and reinforcing a more general trend towards \"balkanization\" of the Internet(s). [1]","description":"This talk is based on a one-year long research conducted at Citizen Lab [2], using a mixed methods approach. On the one hand, we conducted network measurements with OONI probe [3], testing a set of URLs from Crimean vantage points, and comparing results with mainland Russia and Ukraine. We have done an analysis of BGP routing history, and AS neighbouring history, using data from RIPE and CAIDA in collaboration with researchers behind the \"Internet Health Report\" initiative [4] using the recently deployed methodology of \"AS Hegemony Index\" [5]. On the other hand, we conducted an extensive qualitative study, including interviews with Crimean ISPs, Ukrainian and Russian tech activists and representatives of RIPE and other Internet governance bodies; web-ethnography (analysis of professional chats and forums of Crimean / Ukrainian ISPs) and media analysis.\r\n\r\nWe will briefly introduce the context of annexation from the point of view of Internet infrastructure, show an interactive timeline of events that have impacted Crimean Internet ecosystem. Then we will focus on the case of \"Infrastructure interregnum\", where Ukrainian and Russian traffic co-existed for a while. We will share our infographics, including video animation that demonstrates progressive \"wiring\" of Crimea to \"Russian Internet\". On the case of several Ukrainian ISPs we will show how routing becomes matter of dispute. We will question the role of international sanctions and geoblocking by Google, Apple and other big players, on Crimean Internet. Finally, we will conclude with observations of the effects of this infrastructure transition on the end-users, especially activists and journalists working in the region, in terms of their security and the way they experience censorship.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will also share our website [currently under final revisions, will be open to public by October 31, 2018] that presents results of our research in an accessible form for non-tech and non-academic audiences, but also contains longer reports and links for data and infographics that are open for downloading for further reusage, recycling and reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] [Dalek et al., 2014] J.

Di-Dinnng! Gameboy: the electronic soul of the past. It flows across the dance floor like a flash in the fog. We are the symbiosis of man and machine, the pulse drives us, heartbeats counted in BPM, we make sounds out of waves and waves out of sounds, we turn music into emotions and emotions into music, from minimum to maximum, from techno to dubstep. The whole spectrum is dancing. Penetrating sounds move you, electrify you, and the bass is massaging your soul. 8-bit power saves your life. Give yourself a chance. Experience Melted Moon\r\n\r\nMelted Moon started in 2006, when Mathias combined his two hobbies (music and gaming) by converting Gameboys into instruments. Back then, Melted Moon was merely a solo project, which slowly but perceptively gained popularity in Aschaffenburg. Later, in 2012, his friend Stefan joined him, followed by Fabian in 2013. Stefan was more technically savvy, while Fabian brought a lot of musical know-how, and it took just half a year to find a label and release the first album, \"Meltdown\".\r\n\r\nSince the label (Kompuphonik) is affiliated with the well-known band \"Welle:Erdball\", who also use retro computer hardware to create their music, they came in touch with each other and Melted Moon now regularly performs as a sidekick on many large Welle:Erdball concerts. Melted Moon even officially played at \"Rock am Ring\" in 2016 - the largest open air festival of Europe - and has performed on Nintendoom (the largest chiptune festival on the European mainland) twice.\r\n\r\nNot only is Melted Moon known in the music scene - of course Nintendo had to hear about them - not only because of Mathias' conspicuous Nintendo tattoos. And so it came that Melted Moon is also often invited to make some noise at the Gamescom (the largest video games convention of the world) on Nintendo's stage, but Melted Moon is also an integral part of the ROCCAT raffle shows - every year since 2013 - as well as their daily performances on the retro stage in the Gamescom's family area. Also, the city festival of Aschaffenburg features Melted Moon every year on the most central stage of the town - the \"5x4m ABhörn-Bühne\".\r\n\r\nMelted Moon uses only original Gameboy hardware to make music. The Gameboys are, of course, modified with a so-called \"pro sound mod\" (audio output directly from the soundchip to eliminate noise from the volume control), a backlight for the LCD screen, Bluetooth transceivers as a wireless link cable, and MIDI-Out for additional hardware (like SID synthesizers). The software used by Melted Moon is called \"Little Sound DJ\", or LSDJ for short, which runs on flashable third-party cartridges. LSDJ is a tracker program with a \"Live\" mode, where sections in the four individual channels can be played and looped selectively (additional to some live editing and effects).","description":"","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[],"links":[{"url":"https://www.meltedmoon.de/","title":"https://www.meltedmoon.de"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Lineup/events/10091.html","id":10091,"guid":"b4a3ab2d-da99-40a6-acbc-6f18b234f292","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-27T22:00:00+01:00","start":"22:00","duration":"02:00","room":"Discodrama","slug":"35C3-ABFahrplan-10091-konflikt","title":"Konflikt","subtitle":"Techno/House","track":"Music","type":"djset","language":"en","abstract":"","description":"","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[],"links":[{"url":"https://soundcloud.com/herr-koreander","title":"https://soundcloud.com/herr-koreander"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Lineup/events/10086.html","id":10086,"guid":"b63863c1-8e67-4cf8-9a09-da058eb56900","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/010/086/large/VRIL_2019.jpg?1545251026","date":"2018-12-28T00:00:00+01:00","start":"00:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Discodrama","slug":"35C3-ABFahrplan-10086-vril","title":"Vril","subtitle":"Techno Live Set","track":"Music","type":"djset","language":"en","abstract":"Seemingly out of nothing, through dust and with no bang, VRIL appeared on the scene in 2010 with his debut on Giegling.

Sevensol) and Dennis Knoof (a.k.a. Bender). Promoting what they call \"modern dance music,\" and with a discography that includes, among many other immensely talented artists, themselves, Traumprinz, and Falke, it's no surprise that the label is regarded so highly by deep house fans today.","description":"Barich's story has been partly told before: growing up in Leipzig, he began playing the drums aged 14 and subsequently became involved in two band projects, namely Diario and The Hands Of The Wrong People—the former of which was a real success. Steadily, throughout the mid-'90s, he became increasingly interested in electronica, in part down regular visits to Conne Island, an alternative youth cultural center that hosted a rich musical program ranging across the entire spectrum. \"It [Conne Island] certainly shaped my musical personality,\" Barich reflects.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, he began attending illegal techno parties around the city, held in abandoned spaces in the twilight hours after Conne Island's doors had been closed. DJing and production started soon thereafter. He learned to do the former around the age of 14, though only started playing out in the early 2000s; while he taught himself the latter in 2003, inspired by the music he was being exposed too. He was, he says, a \"shy bedroom producer\" who lacked the self-confidence to share his music with labels, leading him to set up KANN in 2008 as an outlet for his productions and those of his partners. The imprint, without question, has been a success, seeing a wide number of wonderful releases and serving as a platform for Map.ache to share his work elsewhere: since quitting his job at Conne Island in 2014, the Leipzig-based artist has released a beautiful collection of musical works. He's certainly an artist on the rise, so what better time to catch up with him to reflect on his journey to date and plans for the future.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[],"links":[{"url":"https://soundcloud.com/ache-map","title":"https://soundcloud.com/ache-map"},{"url":"https://kann-records.com","title":"https://kann-records.com"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Lineup/events/10111.html","id":10111,"guid":"c39ca3be-da21-4910-b107-8de2a6e87dca","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/010/111/large/avatars-000146613399-bud282-t500x500.jpg?1545404839","date":"2018-12-28T04:00:00+01:00","start":"04:00","duration":"02:00","room":"Discodrama","slug":"35C3-ABFahrplan-10111-rss_disco","title":"RSS Disco","subtitle":"Disco/House","track":"Music","type":"djset","language":"en","abstract":"RSS DISCO (originally RSS Music Summary; later, two competing approaches emerged, which used the backronyms Really Simple Seduction and Relatively Serious Sequence respectively) is a type of continuous music feed which allows users and robots to access updates to recorded content in a standardized, computer-readable format.

Freifunk Düren hat vier Jahre Erfahrungen dazu sammeln können, wie auf Events bis zu 300 Clients versorgt werden und wie praxisnah Sachen funktionieren oder nicht. Ursprünglich war das Equipment groß und schwer. Wir zeigen, wie die Installationen so klein werden können, dass das Kisten schleppen entfällt und der Stromverbrauch so niedrig wird, dass mit Solarzellen kleineren Ausmaßes oder Powerbank der Betrieb funktioniert. Vom handlichen Freifunk2go mit LTE Stick für 30 Clients, um Freifunk in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln oder im Park mobil zu realisieren, bis zu einem mobilen LTE Offloader für 300 Clients, werden wir unserer Geräte zeigen. Auch die Aussicht, irgendwann Freifunk auf der Annakirmes anbieten zu können, einem Event in Düren mit bis zu 50.000 Menschen, die gleichzeitig auf dem Kirmesplatz sind, können wir berichten, was dafür benötigt wird. Der Stadt Düren konnten schon erste Vorschläge gemacht werden, die Orientierung dazu ist das WLAN auf dem Congress.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":42,"code":"JGBAWZ","public_name":"Matthias Schmidt","biography":"Seit September 2014 aktiv bei Freifunk Düren und Aachen.","answers":[]}],"links":[],"attachments":[],"answers":[]}],"":[{"id":1150,"guid":"67274860-bfec-45b8-9f32-b710f0497a3f","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-27T20:00:00+01:00","start":"20:00","duration":"0:10","room":"","slug":"35c3-1150-session_join_us_now_and_sing_together_the_free_software_song","title":"\"Join us now and ...\" sing together the Free Software song","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"other","language":"en","abstract":"","description":"Everyday at 20:00 at the Assembly of the Free Software Foundation Europe we invite you to sing together the Free Software song; We have the lyrics and a conductor.

While many modern messengers use end-to-end (e2e) encryption by default, email relies on transport encryption among email servers, which offers a much weaker protection. \r\n\r\nOpenPGP and S/MIME are two competing standards that bring e2e encrypted communication to email. While S/MIME is mostly used in corporate environments and built into many of the widely used email clients, OpenPGP often requires that users install additional software and plugins. Both technologies never reached large deployment, mostly because both suffer from a range of usability issues. However, it is commonly assumed that if one manages to use OpenPGP or S/MIME to encrypt emails, it is very secure.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll discuss several attacks that leak the plaintext of OpenPGP or S/MIME encrypted emails to an attacker.

Was verrät das Handy eines Asylsuchenden aus dem Irak darüber, wo er herkommt? Und ist der Name Wasef eigentlich typisch für Afghanistan? Über diese Fragen entscheiden im Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge (BAMF) zunehmend Computer. Sie spucken Wahrscheinlichkeiten für Herkunftsländer aus, die entscheidend dafür sind, ob Geflüchtete Asyl bekommen - oder nicht. Kurz: Menschliche Schicksale hängen von Maschinen ab. Diese Maschinen wissen nichts darüber, ob einem Menschen in seiner alten Heimat Verfolgung, Folter und Tod drohen. Mitarbeiter des BAMF verlassen sich auf diese Ergebnisse, auch wenn sie falsch sein können. Recherchen und bisher unveröffentlichte Dokumente zeigen, warum das schiefgehen muss und welche schweren Folgen für Schutzsuchende das haben kann.\r\n","description":"Im Jahr 2015 stellte fast <a href=\"https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/pressemitteilungen/DE/2016/01/asylantraege-dezember-2015.html\">eine halbe Million Menschen</a> einen Asylantrag in Deutschland. Das BAMF war überfordert, immer mehr unbearbeitete Anträge sammelten sich an. Der vermeintliche Ausweg lautete Prozessoptimierung. Allein im Jahr 2016 wurden 25 Millionen Euro für Unternehmensberatungen wie McKinsey ausgegeben, die das Amt <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/2017/14/bamf-unternehmensberater-geschwindigkeiten-folgen-fluechtlinge/komplettansicht\">zu einer Entscheidungsfabrik machen</a> sollten. Dass die Behörde über das Schicksal von Menschen entscheidet, trat in den Hintergrund. Immer mehr Entscheidungen in immer kürzerer Zeit, kaum ausgebildete Entscheider, schlechte Übersetzer, massive Datenschutzprobleme und viele falsche Ablehnungen, die im Nachhinein vor Gericht landeten und im Nachhinein revidiert werden mussten.\r\n\r\nEin Beitrag zur vermeintlichen Optimierung sollten IT-Systeme für ein \"Integriertes Identitätsmanagement\" leisten, das aus vier Teilen besteht: Ein \"Transliterationsassistent\" soll Namen in arabischer Schrift einheitlich in lateinische Buchstaben übertragen, um Verwechslungen zu vermeiden und gleichzeitig auswerten, ob der Name im angegebenen Herkunftsland des Geflüchteten vorkommt. Aus einer automatischen Handyauswertung sollen sich Hinweise ergeben, welche Nationalität eine Person hat. Die Technik dafür stammt von einer Firma, die auch für Militär und Geheimdienste arbeitet. Mittels stimmbiometrischer Verfahren sollen die Entscheider Hinweise darauf bekommen, ob ein Antragsteller eher ägyptisches Arabisch spricht oder vielleicht einen levantinischen Dialekt, der auf eine syrische Herkunft hindeutet. Nicht zuletzt sollen biometrische Fotos helfen festzustellen, ob jemand bereits in einer anderen Datenbank registriert wurde. Damit will das BAMF \"Vorreiter bei der Erschließung innovativer Technologien\" sein.\r\n\r\nDoch die neuen IT-Systeme, die kurz vor der Bundestagswahl 2017 vorgestellt wurden, lösen die Probleme des BAMF nicht. Sie schaffen neue und entmenschlichen die Entscheidungen über Schutzsuchende, indem sie die Illusion von Korrektheit und Objektivität erzeugen.\r\n\r\nDurch Recherchen und Gespräche mit Betroffenen erhärtete sich der Verdacht, dass das zum Scheitern verurteilt ist. Geflüchtete erzählten davon, dass BAMF-Mitarbeiter die Systeme nicht richtig bedienen konnten. Ihre Asylakten zeigen, dass sie auch die Ergebnisse fahrlässig interpretiert haben. Sie vertrauten kaum aussagefähigen Prozentangaben aus intransparenten Computerprogrammen mehr als den Schilderungen und Dokumenten der Betroffenen. Bisher unveröffentlichte Dokumente zeigen, dass es sich wohl nicht nur um Einzelfälle handelt.\r\n\r\nNeben der Gefahr, dass Geflüchtete auf Grundlage der automatisierten Auswertungen abgeschoben werden, hat die Digitalisierungsoffensive im BAMF weitere Auswirkungen: Datenschutzprobleme und massenhafte Datenweiterleitungen an den Verfassungsschutz zum Beispiel.

Even though it’s very easy to fork an open software project, pull requests and merges help ensure the main branch of a project continues to improve. Furthermore, open software projects tend to evolve along with their tools, as evidenced by the concurrent maturation of Servo and Rust, or Linux and Git. In contrast, open hardware projects tend to fork and then fracture the community as they gain commercial success and go closed, as evidenced in the evolution of the 3D printer and drone communities. There are also few examples of hardware projects that co-evolve with their tools.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe evolution of the <a href=\"https://kosagi.com/w/index.php/NeTV_Main_Page\">NeTV</a> + Milkymist to the <a href=\"hdmi2usb.tv\">HDMI2USB</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/alphamax/netv2\">NeTV2</a>, along with the concurrent maturation and adoption of the <a href=\"https://m-labs.hk/migen/\">Migen</a> and <a href=\"http://www.enjoy-digital.fr/\">LiteX ecosystem</a>, is one of these rare examples.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis talk will present a historical narrative of the background behind each of these projects and how they became interlinked. From the study of this history, we will attempt to distill a few core lessons learned that can hopefully be applied to other open hardware projects. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOne important lesson is that open anything takes time and patience, and so the project itself needs to be in a space where it can move at an appropriate pace to grow a healthy community while maintaining relevance against potentially better-funded closed-source options. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAnother lesson is the importance of crowdfunding as a mechanism to marshall community around a given release, as opposed to relying upon sources of financing that expect direct returns on investment (such as venture capital or loans). \r\n</p><p>\r\nA final example of a lesson we will discuss is the importance of picking the right tools to co-evolve with the project. While many open source options alternatives exist to closed-source tools, it’s problematic if the design tools somehow limit the hardware implementation or introduces flaws in the design itself -- and hardware, unlike software, cannot be patched. Migen/LiteX are front-end tooling for describing FPGA designs (“gateware”), and their output being a bitstream means it can be in the hardware space while enjoying the privilege of easy patching and updates. Furthermore, Migen/LiteX offer critical features and performance metrics unavailable in the closed-source alternatives, meaning that these are not simply design tools, they are also core to enabling the competitiveness of the hardware itself.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Related previous Chaos Congress Talks</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/v/cccamp11-4412-latest_developments_around_the_milkymist_system_on_chip-en\"> Latest developments around the Milkymist System-on-Chip - A roundup of one the most advanced open hardware projects</a></li>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/v/28c3-4686-en-implementation_of_mitm_attack_on_hdcp_secured_links\"> Implementation of MITM Attack on HDCP-Secured Links - A non-copyright circumventing application of the HDCP master key</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8057-dissecting_hdmi\">Dissecting HDMI - Developing open, FPGA-based capture hardware for conference & user group recording</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Presenters</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://blog.mithis.net\">Tim 'mithro' Ansell</a> is the founder of <a href=\"http://code.timvideos.us\">TimVideos</a>.

We come upon an open, free-spirited society. The events of the CCC are a kind of utopian real-world reflection of the virtual spectrum. We encounter angels, activists, robots, coders and makers. We learn what a hack is, why lockpicking can be important, how a cellular system works. We dive into the game and become part of the community that is as inclusive as it is sophisticated. Still outside of this collective the challenges are immense in an era, in which political certainties and institutions increasingly erode. Models of governance, economics, social order, technology and science are being put into question 24/7. With the internet’s rules of conduct, national laws are being repealed and transformed into global structures. While  the worldwide web would structurally actually allow a radical renewal of democracy, changing it from representation to participation, more and more states are drifting towards authoritarian societies in political reality. In the course of that process, en passant the largest surveillance machinery of human history has been created.\r\nWe see how the hacker culture meets these challenges and what inner contradictions it encounters. We learn that our lives are not determined by general, given truths but actually through the way we work, develop ourselves, suffer or dream.

Telephony is now merging many complex\r\ntechnologies (PSTN, cellular and IP networks) and enabling numerous\r\nservices that can be easily  monetized. However, security challenges for\r\ntelephony are often neither well understood, nor well addressed. As a\r\nresult, telephone networks attract a lot of fraud. In this talk, we will\r\nsystematically explore the fraud in telephone networks, focusing on\r\nvoice telephony. We will present a taxonomy of fraud, and analyze two\r\nprevalent fraud schemes in more detail: looking into the ecosystem of\r\nInternational Revenue Share Fraud (IRSF), and discussing a new\r\ncountermeasure to the well-known problem of voice spam.","description":"This talk aims to improve the understanding of the fraud ecosystem in\r\ntelephony networks. We first provide a clear taxonomy that\r\ndifferentiates between the root causes, the vulnerabilities, the\r\nexploitation techniques, the fraud types and finally the way fraud\r\nbenefits fraudsters.\r\n\r\nAs concrete examples, we first look into International Revenue Share\r\nFraud (IRSF), where phone calls to certain destinations are hijacked by fraudulent operators and diverted to the so-called ‘international premium rate services’. This fraud often involves multiple parties who collect and share the call revenue, and is usually combined with other\r\ntechniques (such as voice scam, mobile malware, PBX hacking) to generate call traffic without payment. We will further explore the IRSF ecosystem by analyzing more than 1 million `premium rate' phone numbers that we collected from several online service providers over the past 3 years.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we will look into voice spam, a prevalent fraud in\r\nmany countries. After giving an overview of various types of unwanted phone calls, we will focus on a recent countermeasure which involves connecting the phone spammer with a phone bot (“robocallee”) that mimics a real persona. Lenny is such a bot (a computer program) which plays a set of pre-recorded voice messages to interact with the spammers. We try to understand the effectiveness of this chatbot, by analyzing the recorded conversations of Lenny with various types of spammers. As we consider the ‘benefits’ as a fundamental part of our fraud definition, we believe that chatbots can be combined with the existing fraud detection and prevention mechanisms, as a supplementary way of slowing down voice spam campaigns.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":7804,"public_name":"Merve Sahin"},{"id":8646,"public_name":"Aurélien Francillon"}],"links":[{"url":"http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/docs/eurosp17_sahin.pdf","title":"SoK: Fraud in Telephony Networks"},{"url":"http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/docs/soups17_sahin.pdf","title":"Using chatbots against voice spam: Analyzing Lenny’s effectiveness"},{"url":"https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2018/poster-abstracts/oakland2018-paper31-poster-abstract.pdf","title":"IRSF"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9631.html","id":9631,"guid":"14281f92-873c-478c-a962-f1eb8b6c15d9","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T12:50:00+01:00","start":"12:50","duration":"01:00","room":"Clarke","slug":"35c3-9631-symbiflow_-_finally_the_gcc_of_fpgas","title":"SymbiFlow - Finally the GCC of FPGAs!","subtitle":"A fully FOSS, Verilog to bitstream, timing driven, cross FPGA, usable toolchain.","track":"Hardware & Making","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"The <a href=\"http://symbiflow.github.io\">SymbiFlow project</a> aims to be the \"GCC of FPGAs\" - a fully open source toolchain supporting, multiple FPGAs from different vendors.

While \"agile\" has given developers autonomy over the soul-crushing processes of the past, the prevalent technology - object-orientation - is a fundamental part of the problem, not of the solution.

Experiments are not an option in astrophysics. We cannot form planets, stars, or galaxies in laboratories on earth, but only observe them in an uncontrolled fashion using telescopes. We therefore rely on mathematical models that predict observations which we can test in reality. As the range of analytically tractable problems is very limited we rely on computers to numerically help us to understand the cosmos.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will concentrate on a specific branch of astrophysics and cosmology, the science of the evolution of the Universe as a whole: simulations of cosmological structure formation. These simulations follow dark matter in an expanding universe as it collapses under the influence of gravity into the structures which are the birthplaces of galaxies. We will see how these galaxies are glowing tracers on the highly complex, almost invisible structure of the cosmic web.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these simulations are immense computational undertakings and take tens of millions of core-hours to run on tens of thousand of cores while producing hundreds of tera- if not petabytes of output. Throughout their history they have pushed to the limits of technical feasibility and limits of computing power. They are so rich in information that teams of scientists can find new results in them years, sometimes even more than a decade, after they were run.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick overview of our current understanding of the development of the Universe I will give an introduction to simulations of the dynamics of dark matter with so-called N-body simulations and how these were developed in the 20th century. We will then explore how people follow the evolution of gas and galaxies in these simulations to fill the darkness with stars, supernovae, black holes and sometimes even light. Finally, I will show how these simulations are comparing against our observations and how they helped us to further our understanding of what the Universe is made of, before ending with a short outlook on how cosmological simulations might improve in the future to explain more phenomena and keep up with observations.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8101,"public_name":"Philipp Busch"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9926.html","id":9926,"guid":"bc545b26-8319-43fb-abc2-f624ef414ee8","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T23:30:00+01:00","start":"23:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Dijkstra","slug":"35c3-9926-the_year_in_post-quantum_crypto","title":"The year in post-quantum crypto","subtitle":"","track":"Security","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"  The world is finally catching on to the urgency\r\n  of deploying post-quantum cryptography:\r\n  cryptography designed to survive attacks by quantum computers.\r\n  NIST's post-quantum competition is in full swing,\r\n  and network protocols are exploring post-quantum extensions.\r\n  This talk will take the audience on a journey\r\n  through selected recent highlights\r\n  from the post-quantum world.","description":"  Post-quantum cryptography has become one of the most active\r\n  areas in cryptography,\r\n  trying to address important questions from potential users.\r\n\r\n  Is post-quantum cryptography secure?\r\n  In the first ten months of this year\r\n  we have seen several serious breaks\r\n  of submissions to the NIST competition.\r\n  At this point, out of the original 69 submissions,\r\n  13 are broken and 8 are partially broken.\r\n  Are the remaining 48 submissions all secure?\r\n  Or is this competition a denial-of-service attack\r\n  against the cryptanalysis community?\r\n  NIST will select fewer candidates for the 2nd round,\r\n  but it is not clear whether there is an adequate basis\r\n  for judging security.\r\n\r\n  Does post-quantum cryptography provide\r\n  the functionality we expect from cryptography?\r\n  For example,\r\n  the original Diffie-Hellman system\r\n  provides not just encryption\r\n  but also more advanced features\r\n  such as non-interactive key exchange\r\n  (not provided by any NIST submissions)\r\n  and blinding.\r\n  The era of post-NIST post-quantum cryptography has begun\r\n  with the exciting new CSIDH proposal,\r\n  which has non-interactive key exchange\r\n  and is smaller than any NIST submission,\r\n  but uses more CPU time and needs much more study.\r\n\r\n  Is post-quantum cryptography small enough?\r\n  Even for network protocols that rely purely on encryption,\r\n  integration remains a major problem\r\n  because of the bandwidth requirements of most post-quantum systems,\r\n  especially the post-quantum systems\r\n  with the strongest security track records.\r\n  Experiments with integration of post-quantum cryptography into TLS\r\n  have focused on encryption without post-quantum authentication.\r\n  A new generation of network protocols\r\n  has been designed from the ground up for full post-quantum security.\r\n\r\n  Is post-quantum cryptographic software fast enough,\r\n  and is it safe to use?\r\n  Adding post-quantum cryptography\r\n  to the cryptographic software ecosystem\r\n  has produced a giant step backwards in software quality.\r\n  Major areas of current activity include\r\n  software speedups,\r\n  benchmarking,\r\n  bug fixes,\r\n  formal verification,\r\n  patent avoidance, and\r\n  development of post-quantum software libraries\r\n  such as Open Quantum Safe and libpqcrypto.\r\n\r\n  The talk will be given as a joint presentation\r\n  by Daniel J.

As the internet has gotten stronger, the asynchronous and offline methods of sharing data are rapidly disappearing.  There has not been enough investment in the many other possible nets, even though they are often better suited for situations where connectivity is not available or affordable. The potential in radios, sensors and processing available in the cheapest of smartphones and routers are not fully utilized or realized.\r\n\r\nWind is a network designed for opportunistic communication and sharing of local knowledge. It is built on impermanence, movement, and spontaneity.  Wind is a direct counterpoint to the metaphor of the Web, a system built upon the concept of fixed physical nodes, centralized authorities and permanent links. It is rooted in the mindsets and needs of people and communities who face challenges communicating. Wind is shaped by the movements and density of people in time and space.\r\n\r\nThe Wind project began with giving F-Droid the ability to \"swap apps\" using only Bluetooth and local Wi-Fi connections.  We have enabled users with limited connectivity to gather and share media to archive.org via OpenArchive.  Added \"nearby\" data exchange to share sensitive or blocked news via Proofmode and Courier.  LibraryBoxen are integrated in as relay or source of data. \r\n\r\nGuardian Project always works in partnership with the people and organizations whose needs we are aiming to address.  Real world solutions do not exist in a bubble, so we always integrate with established free software projects, as well as develop design guidelines and document key concepts to spread all aspects of this research.  This work was undertaken in partnership with Tibetans facing internet shutdowns, Cubans working with their own separate networks, Latin Americans facing expensive data plans, and people all over the world who experience outages and unreliable connectivity.\r\n\r\nFor Wind, our development approach is to incrementally improve upon existing efforts, while also focusing on developing the new integration glue necessary to provide a smooth, usable and practical to deploy experience. We are not inventing a new stack or protocol from scratch, or envisioning a utopian silo in which our systems solves all of the potential problems end-to-end. The issue that we see is that there are many potential components, protocols or software libraries that exist today, but that they have not been unified into a cohesive, usable experience that promotes easy deployment, bootstrapping and adoption.\r\n\r\nThis work just won fourth prize in the Mozilla \"Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society\" Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge, providing us funding to take the next step in the development.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5330,"public_name":"Hans-Christoph Steiner"}],"links":[{"url":"https://guardianproject.info/wind/","title":"Guardian Project's Wind page"},{"url":"https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org/#grand-winners-1","title":"Mozilla \"Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society\" Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge"},{"url":"https://okthanks.com/blog/peronas-latin-america","title":"Latin American Personas for guiding design processes"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9915.html","id":9915,"guid":"765cb049-78f4-4997-8cc6-238283e241a8","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T17:30:00+01:00","start":"17:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Eliza","slug":"35c3-9915-projekt_hannah","title":"Projekt Hannah","subtitle":"Ein open-source Hardware- und Software-Design für vierbeinige Laufroboter","track":"Hardware & Making","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Um das Entwickeln von eigenen Laufrobotern zu erleichtern, brauchen wir offene Alternativen zu bestehenden Plattformen.

Außerdem sind wir überzeugt, dass zukünftige Robotik/KI-Systeme für die Menschheit allgemein förderlich sein werden, wenn die zugrundeliegende Technologie unabhängig von privaten Interessen und in den Händen von Wissenschaftlern, Ingenieuren und Hackern weltweit ist.\r\n\r\nBei der Entwicklung von Laufrobotern ist die notwendige Hardware oft nicht erschwinglich, oder die Quellen für die Hardware-Designs oder die Software schwer zugänglich. Einen Laufroboter von Grund auf zu entwickeln kann leicht mehrere Jahre dauern, was für Forscher und Hobbyisten viel Aufwand bedeutet und für Startups ein hohes Risiko darstellt.\r\n\r\nWir entwickeln ein völlig freies quelloffenes Hardware- und Software-Design für einen Laufroboter, welches von allen verwendet, studiert, modifiziert und verteilt werden kann, und wollen damit einen Beitrag zur Demokratisierung des Bereichs der Laufroboter leisten. Das mechanische Design besteht aus 3D-gedruckten oder Laser-geschnitten Teilen, welche anderweitig zu teuer wären, bzw. aus Standardteilen, welche vielerorts günstig erworben werden können. Der Roboter kann somit leicht im lokalen Hackspace oder zu Hause nachgebaut werden. Das Motorsteuerungssystem ist eine ebenfalls quelloffene Elektronik- und Firmware-Eigenentwicklung zur einfachen Regelung von DC-Motoren inklusive eines flexiblen Bussystems zur Echtzeitkommunikation.

This talk will investigate advantages and disadvantages of different methods with regards to cryptographic backdoors known as kleptograms.","description":"With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, there is now a variety of different wallet solutions and products available. Wallet in this context refers to any device or piece of software which store secret keys. Those secret keys are typically used to create and sign transactions (payments, smart contracts, etc.) using ECDSA.\r\n\r\nWallet implementations range from simple open-source software to hardware tokens. Some solutions store the keys in files (possibly encrypted with a passphrase), while others use hardware-based cryptography modules. Hardware-based key storage comes with a lot of advantages. The chips are designed to make it hard to extract keys.\r\n\r\nWhat is often overlooked is that it is hard to verify that the wallet actually does what the manufacturer claims it does. One obvious solution is to not connect the wallet to a computer with Internet access in order to avoid exposure of secrets. However, there are possible cryptographic backdoors called kleptograms that can hide the secret information within the published signatures in a way that is provably undetectable.\r\n\r\nThe kleptographic attacks were first discovered by Adam Young and Moti Yung in 1997 for classic DSA. The author of this talk has investigated the relevance of this attack for ECDSA in the context of Bitcoin. Note that this attack is not limited to Bitcoin and might be relevant for other ECDSA-based protocols as well.\r\n","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8297,"public_name":"Stephan Verbücheln"}],"links":[{"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00447","title":" How Perfect Offline Wallets Can Still Leak Bitcoin Private Keys"}],"attachments":[{"url":"/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/003/727/original/35c3_wallet_security.pdf?1546275895","title":"Slides"}]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9939.html","id":9939,"guid":"2536bba3-b95f-4cec-9a95-7aa756db7edb","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/009/939/large/ccc_talk4.jpg?1545941976","date":"2018-12-28T22:50:00+01:00","start":"22:50","duration":"00:40","room":"Eliza","slug":"35c3-9939-disnovation_org","title":"DISNOVATION.ORG","subtitle":"Disobedient Innovation","track":"Art & Culture","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Through the hacking of surveillance techniques, machine learning, and big-data analytics, DISNOVATION.ORG’s trilogy of internet bots is uncovering and repurposing some of the influential and opaque operating systems of our online environment.

While attempts to introduce \"Aaron's Law\" in the US ultimately failed, in this talk I'll talk about the developments in a number of jurisdictions that make Aarons Law-type reforms a realistic project in the next few years.

Warum verwendet man Hochspannung? Wieso bauen Netzbetreiber lieber Freileitungen, als ein Kabel in den Boden zu legen? Die Energiewende verändert derzeit das elektrische Netz ungemein. Erneuerbare Energien übernehmen immer mehr die Aufgaben von Großkraftwerken und bringen dadurch völlig neue Herausforderungen mit sich. Plötzlich gibt es zu einigen Zeiten Überkapazitäten, die nicht nur zu absurden Effekten an der Strombörse in Leipzig führen, sondern auch gefährlich für die Netzstabilität werden können. Dann gibt es wiederum Tage, an denen die Erneuerbaren Energien fast nichts zum Strommix beitragen und der Großteil der elektrischen Energie aus Kohle-, Gas- und (noch) Kernkraftwerken kommt. Wir gehen den Fragen nach, ob die neuen dezentralen Energiequellen wirklich so dezentral sind, wie es heiß, ob neue Leitungen wirklich nur wegen der Energiewende gebaut werden oder nicht doch auch aus Profitgründen und warum Kabel oft nicht die bessere Alternative zu Freileitungen sind.

Wir alle sind eine potenzielle Bedrohung und müssen mit Kameras, Maschinenpistolen und Überwachungstechnik in Schach gehalten werden. Der Staat scheint sich vor uns schützen zu wollen aber wie schützen wir uns eigentlich vor dem Staat?\r\n\r\nIm sächsischen Landtag wird derzeit über ein neues Polizeigesetz verhandelt. In Bayern soll ein ähnliches Gesetz verabschiedet werden und stößt auf viel Widerstand.\r\nNicht umsonst wird der (bayerische) Entwurf als „schärfstes Polizeigesetz seit 1945“ bezeichnet: Die Polizei soll umfangreiche neue Befugnisse erhalten, selbstständig Grundrechte einschränken und uns alle überwachen und bespitzeln dürfen. Gleichzeitig werden die Einheiten militärisch aufgerüstet und bewaffnet. Hier werden Freiheitsrechte und die Unschuldsvermutung mit Füßen getreten. Es wird verstärkt ein Klima der Angst und des gegenseitigen Misstrauens geschaffen. Der Rechtsstaat verändert sich immer mehr hin zu einem autoritären Polizeistaat. Diese Entwicklung betrifft uns alle!\r\n\r\nAngriff auf Grundrechte\r\n\r\nDas Gesetz gibt der Polizei Befugnisse bei einer „drohenden Gefahr“ und gegenüber sogenannten Gefährdern. Die sächsische Polizei könnte dann bei bloßen Vermutungen ermitteln, ohne dass überhaupt ein Verbrechen begangen wurde oder ein begründeter Verdacht vorliegt. Das bedeutet: Die Polizei kann quasi gegen jede/n ermitteln. So würde das Polizeigesetz die Unschuldsvermutung außer Kraft setzen.\r\nEine Art Hausarrest (Aufenthaltsgebot §21) bis zu drei Monaten kann die Polizei verhängen, auch ohne richterlichen Beschluss. Dies kann sie mittels elektronischer Fußfesseln durchsetzten. Jede Privatsphäre von Betroffenen kann ohne konkreten Vorwurf ausgehebelt werden. Auch Verdächtige und Verurteilte haben Grundrechte. Das unterscheidet einen Rechtsstaat vom Polizeistaat.\r\nMit dem neuen Polizeigesetz soll auch der besondere Schutz für Journalist/Innen und Beratungsstellen aufgehoben werden. Die Polizei darf diese dann auch nach eigenem Ermessen abhören und überwachen. Das ist ein drastischer Eingriff in die Pressefreiheit und gefährdet das Vertrauen in diese Institutionen.\r\nDas neue Polizeigesetz rüttelt an der körperlichen Unversehrtheit, der persönlichen Freiheit, dem Recht auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung, dem Briefgeheimnis, der Unverletztlichkeit der Wohnung. Das Gesetz ist ein Angriff auf unsere Grundrechte und die Grundfesten des Zusammenlebens. Das können wir nicht hinnehmen!\r\n\r\nRassismus und Abschottung\r\n\r\nViele der Maßnahmen, die im Gesetz vorgesehen sind, richten sich offensiv gegen Geflüchtete und Menschen, die nicht in Deutschland geboren sind. Die Einstufung von Refugee-Unterkünften als sogenannte „gefährliche Orte“ stellt alle dort Lebenden unter Generalverdacht und lässt zu sie jederzeit zu kontrollieren. Hausarrest und technische Überwachung erleichtern es, Menschen jederzeit orten und abschieben zu können.\r\nStärkere Grenzkontrollen mithilfe von Videoüberwachung und Gesichtserkennung dienen nicht der allgemeinen Sicherheit sondern der Abschottung nach außen.\r\nDer Staat nimmt sich hier das Recht, Menschen als Kriminelle zu behandeln, sie zu bevormunden und zu schikanieren und das ausschließlich auf Grund ihrer Hautfarbe und Herkunft. Das ist keine Sicherheitspolitik, das ist rassistische Ausgrenzung. Flucht ist kein Verbrechen – Bewegungsfreiheit ist Menschenrecht!\r\n\r\nÜberwachung um jeden Preis\r\n\r\nDas neue Gesetz würde die Videoüberwachung noch mehr ausweiten: Auch die Polizeibehörden, also die Kommunen, sollen künftig mit Kameras überwachen dürfen. Kennzeichen, Ort, Zeit und Fahrtrichtung von Autos soll die Polizei zu bestimmten Anlässen automatisch erfassen dürfen. In grenznahen Gebieten soll sogar automatische Gesichtserkennung ermöglicht werden.\r\nDer Öffentliche Raum wird so immer mehr überwacht. Der Staat soll überall zuschauen.\r\nZusammen mit den vielen digitalen Überwachungsprogrammen führt das zum „gläsernen Menschen“. Wir lassen uns nicht belauschen und überwachen. Wir haben ein Recht auf Privatsphäre!\r\n\r\nGrungrechte statt Polizeisonderrechte\r\n\r\nAuch Polizeibeamt*innen im Dienst begehen Straftaten. Es kommt jedoch selten zu Prozessen gegen sie und sie werden praktisch nie verurteilt, obwohl Betroffene Anzeige erstatten. . Wir fordern dagegen, auch Polizist*innen zur Verantwortung zu ziehen: Mit einer Kennzeichnungspflicht könnten Beamt*innen nach Straftaten juristisch verfolgt werden. Eine Beschwerdestelle könnte ein Beginn sein, Polizei zu kontrollieren und Missständen entgegenzuwirken – wenn sie unabhängig ist. Das würde die Grundrechte Aller stärken.\r\nStattdessen bleiben diese wiederholten Forderungen unbeachtet, Polizist*innen „kontrollieren“ sich gegenseitig und interne Ermittlungen enden weiterhin an einer Mauer des Schweigens. Keine andere Berufs- oder Bevölkerungsgruppe hat solche Sonderrechte.\r\n\r\nParagraphen\r\n\r\nMilitarisierung, Bewaffnung (§40)\r\n\r\nEinige Polizeieinheiten tragen künftig Handgranaten, Maschinengewehre und anderes militärisches Equitment.\r\n\r\nHausarrest & Fußfesseln (§21)\r\n\r\nDie Polizei kann dir zukünft verbieten dich an bestimmten Orten aufzuhalten, dir den Kontakt zu bestimmten Menschen untersagen, dich zwingen einen festen Bereich nicht zu verlassen oder dich unter Hausarrest stellen. Dazu darf sie dich auch zwingen eine elektronische Fußfessel zu tragen.\r\n\r\nVideoüberwachung, Gesichtserkennung (§ 15, § 58 sowie § 30 PVB)\r\n\r\nZukünftig dar der öffentliche Raum noch stärker videoüberwacht werden. Dazu darf auch Gesichtserkennungstechnik und Kennzeichenerfassung eingesetzt werden. Es kann dadurch genau erfasst werden, wann du dich wo in diesen Bereichen aufgehalten hast. Auch das Ordnungsamt und die Kommunen dürfen diese Technik einsetzen. Sie ist nicht auf konkrete Ermittlungen beschränkt.\r\n\r\nTelefon- und Handyüberwachung (§§ 66-70)\r\n\r\nZukünftig dürfen Polizeibeamte nicht nur Telefonate abhören, sondern sie auch unterbrechen. Das gilt auch für ganze Funkmasten. Der Handyempfang kann so etwa in ganzen Gebieten (etwa bei Demos) unterbrochen werden. Außerdem dürfen auch die Bestandsdaten eines Mobiltelefons ausgelesen werden. Also: Name, Adresse, Kontodaten, PIN & PUK Nummer, gespeicherte Passwörter, alles Accountzugänge auf dem Telefon, Mailaccounts und gespeicherte Bilder und Kontakte.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":13,"name":"Anarchist Black Cross Dresden","biography":"Anarchist Black Cross Dresden ist ein Kollektiv von Menschen das sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat Ideen über Anarchismus und Solidarität zu verbreiten.

It currently directs WorkHive, a flexible, affordable, inclusive and carbon negative coworking space in Copenhagen. The collaboration with Nigerian-based Fantsuam tries to integrate best practices of Freifunk, Fantsuam and WorkHive to create a new coworking space in Kafanchan, Nigeria.\r\n\r\n###About Fantsuam\r\nOur Mission at Fantsuam Foundation (www.fantsuam.org) is to eliminate poverty and disadvantage among rural women and youths in Nigeria through integrated development programs. At our ICT Academy,In 22 years, we have empowered 12,000, and we aim to educate women and youths with relevant digital literacy skills to manage their development priorities, providing opportunities for girls to become developers and deploy ICT solutions for their livelihoods. Our services have become even more imperative as our communities come out of decade long cycles of sectarian violence. We plan to reach 25,000 more by 2020.\r\n\r\nCommunity Network, is a resilient communication platform in which the community owns, manages and maintains its own communication infrastructure provides the opportunities for rural youths to gain the necessary hands-on experience. Fantsuam Foundation hosts the Google Developers Group in Kafanchan, this is another resource that is being deployed to provide ICT skills and knowledge opportunities for our youths.\r\n\r\nWe are now  engaged in high level policy advocacy for affordable and available internet access for the unconnected in rural Nigeria. Obtaining the TVWS concession for the unconnected in Nigeria will begin to make for an inclusive national telecommunication effort. It is within that context that Fantsuam continues to support the increasing number of youths, particularly females, who now recognise the career opportunities available in ICT. Our ICT Academy provides basic digital literacy training and has expanded to provision of training in computer and network maintenance. In order to optimise the use of resources and make our services more accessible, we have located an office space in the Kafanchan Railway town where we would like to set up an ICT Co-Working space where budding entrepreneurs can have ready access to training and mentoring facilities, office space with assured power and internet access at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nOur efforts at tackling poverty through an integrated approach has meant that we also provide social services in public health, menstrual health hygiene, sanitation marketing, peace building, entrepreneurship training supported by microfinance. We currently have 32 full time staff and a large pool of volunteers who are invited to join specific projects and programs, which are usually of short duration. Our work in peace building led us to build six new apartments for victims of recent sectarian crisis, and we continue to explore opportunities to enable our communities to resume their normal lives.

We all know where that kind of behavior goes, when 'caring runs rampant' and you try care for people who dont care similarly for you -> stress, depression, anxiety, fear of rejection, etc.\r\nThat was OK too, because that in turn taught me a lot about caring for myself...\r\nGo read some more on the anthropological and socio-economic aspects of caretaking, it's a very interesting topic if not a form of art/craft in itself.\r\n\r\nGiving back to the world\r\nI'm also a philosopher, software developer, mathematician, statistician, data visualiser, test engineer, consultant, entrepreneur, photographer, inventor, permaculture designer, volunteer, counsellor, , interaction designer, ethnographer, business developer, market analyst, etc. and am truly blessed with many close friends that I can team up with to co-create 'truly good stuff with a focus and a purpose'.\r\nI'm currently working on WorkHive - the tagline of which is 'Making space for people and plants to be productive'.

It's a networking platform, enabling people to be more productive on their own things, and to get inspiration from others in the same or different situations and with different perspectives - being able to do short, informal reviews of your own work in a safe space together with an 'unwilling third person' has a huge implication for the success of your work before sending it out to your real audience in the big world.\r\n(What about the plants?

There, he didn’t just play music, but actually built the DJ booths where the music was played from. This unique blend of passion for music and intrigue in aesthetic concepts has driven him through the mesmerising Berlin underground since the end of the '90s. Dave is personalizing his workspace as a DJ according to his interpretation of what electronic music culture is all about. There is a certain warmth, honesty and depth throughout his work that transcends through both his musicality and his design treatments. As a core member of Berlins famous Bachstelzen Collective, he was one of the founders who blueprinted what got to be known as the typical Berlin style – an architecture of social, musical and aesthetic concepts. Using chaotic, wild and organic scrap wood in his constructions were his distinctive signature well before the term ‘up-cycling‘ became hip. Bar25, the Katerholzig club and the Bachstelzen floor at Fusion Festival were prototypes of this time. His recent works contain a more polarising focus; a love for minimalistic abstract geometry, and years of experience in project management. Nothing shows this development in a greater way than Garbicz Festival — whose natural, albeit utopian habitat has become a homebase for both his music and his design aesthetics. An invitation to create the celebrated Turmbühne Stage at Fusion Festival’s 20th anniversary along with a coveted gig on the stage marked a milestone for both of his careers. For Dave, spacial design and sound are tools for installing an arena for unconventional social interactions. A sphere where common aesthetics are to be challenged and will change therefore constantly. His residency in KaterBlau helped him to build up his reputation as a DJ and to grow into the international realm. In the last years he has worked and played in Australia, New Zealand, India and all around Europe. There is a saying that ‘To talk about music, is like dancing to architecture’ - Dave Dinger takes the latter part as a challenge. So let his music speak for itself — and dance to both.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[],"links":[{"url":"https://soundcloud.com/dave-dinger","title":"https://soundcloud.com/dave-dinger"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Lineup/events/10083.html","id":10083,"guid":"4fc77737-db51-409d-88bc-ad025d8a3ebf","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/010/083/large/avatars-000007049727-oyxhri-t500x500.jpg?1545408610","date":"2018-12-29T02:00:00+01:00","start":"02:00","duration":"02:00","room":"Discodrama","slug":"35C3-ABFahrplan-10083-akaak","title":"akaak","subtitle":"House","track":"Music","type":"djset","language":"en","abstract":"akaak is also a member of hamburg-based dj-trio sutsche","description":"","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[],"links":[{"url":"https://soundcloud.com/akaak_klingtsogut","title":"https://soundcloud.com/akaak_klingtsogut"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Lineup/events/10071.html","id":10071,"guid":"0678ee05-7581-4523-a2e3-f1485eb89998","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-29T04:00:00+01:00","start":"04:00","duration":"02:00","room":"Discodrama","slug":"35C3-ABFahrplan-10071-404","title":"404","subtitle":"Electronica, Downbeat","track":"Music","type":"djset","language":"en","abstract":"dj 7000, bidi, 404, köfte, dj abbau, dj closing, ayran, tyskie, dj partner set, and more ...","description":"Unter gewaltigen Opfern, schreibt er eine Reihe von Geschichten mit Ortsnamen, Jahreszahlen und sonstigen Daten, die sich durchaus belegen lassen und in ihrer Wirklichkeit nicht anzuzweifeln sind.

Lippstueck prominently sings, wordless and backwards in time, while his partner jayrope tends to also appreciate any DIY, electronic, string or percussion instrument small enough to fit into a single suitcase altogether. \r\nChanging setup and subsequently music is programmatic to them, as well as having friends as guest musicians, all resulting into an unforeseeable slow motion cacophony of whispers, bleeps, rhythms and harmonies. \r\nThere’s a notion of Dada, but you never know.\r\n\r\nThis rather poetic note about their separation from cemented structures & styles took them to places. ACF got to support a number of their own favourite artists along the line. Subsequently ACF’s 8th album FLINK – upon a friendly invitation – was recorded and mixed with Thierry Amar at Montreal’s Hotel2Tango. For the first time in a proper studio, if you will, but nonetheless with an audience present at recording time.

Shortly afterwards, a group of school friends, including rappers Thiat and Kilifeu, set up ‘Y’en a marre’ (‘We Are Fed Up’). Filmmaker Rama Thiaw soon came on board to start documenting events (meetings, campaigns, arrests, concerts, states of exhaustion, trips) from an insider’s perspective. This documentary is the second volume of Rama Thiaw’s trilogy of documentaries, where she highlights the relationship between politics and culture. It started with ‘Boul Fallé, the Way of Struggle’ shot in 2009, and the third volume of this trilogy will follow 6 reggae musicians in different countries. ‘The Revolution Won’t Be Televised’ was presented at the 2016 Berlinale and won the Prize of Critics from ‘FIPRESCI’ in the Forum category and a mention from Caligari Filmpreis. Rama Thiaw offers a truly aesthetic documentary, where she narrates a part of Senegalese history and explains how her home country is about to change.","track":"self organized sessions","type":"","language":"","abstract":"","description":"","persons":[],"links":["https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Film_--_C2X:_The_television_will_not_be_revolutionized."]},{"id":1343,"guid":"62abca03-5040-4b24-bc1d-a23208f5b782","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T20:13:00+01:00","start":"20:13","duration":"1:32","room":"ChaosFilmSociety Art-and-Play","slug":"35c3-1343-session_film_global_home","title":"Film -- Global Home","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"","language":"","abstract":"","description":"The film explores a thrilling new way of travelling and reveals a longing for more authentic forms of human interaction.","persons":[],"links":["https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Film_--_Global_Home"]},{"id":1346,"guid":"49cd6184-57ff-4675-ad62-68152fb9efa2","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T22:00:00+01:00","start":"22:00","duration":"1:20","room":"ChaosFilmSociety Art-and-Play","slug":"35c3-1346-session_film_illegale_film","title":"Film -- Illegale Film","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"","language":"","abstract":"","description":"If everything really does become a product – art, ideas, colours, the pictures of our surroundings and even our ‘selfies’ – then who do the pictures we take of ourselves, and our world belong to?","persons":[],"links":["https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Film_--_Illegale_Film"]},{"id":1350,"guid":"f4745f8e-bc7f-4fdc-b570-20f294edef58","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-29T02:11:00+01:00","start":"02:11","duration":"0:21","room":"ChaosFilmSociety Art-and-Play","slug":"35c3-1350-session_film_one_million_steps","title":"Film -- One Million Steps","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"","language":"","abstract":"","description":"A tap dancer performs, while elsewhere people run from the tear gas of the police","persons":[],"links":["https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Film_--_One_Million_Steps"]},{"id":1351,"guid":"cdf34f34-3118-4515-8ba0-189423744ab1","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T23:20:00+01:00","start":"23:20","duration":"1:01","room":"ChaosFilmSociety Art-and-Play","slug":"35c3-1351-session_film_sollbruchstelle_devil_hides_in_doubt","title":"Film -- Sollbruchstelle / Devil hides in Doubt","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"","language":"","abstract":"","description":"A film about the emotional push and pull of work, its demands and absurdities, and the struggle for fulfilment.","persons":[],"links":["https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Film_--_Sollbruchstelle_/_Devil_hides_in_Doubt"]},{"id":1352,"guid":"efb72ebf-d180-47f6-bc49-ffa546c6c910","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-29T02:32:00+01:00","start":"02:32","duration":"2:10","room":"ChaosFilmSociety Art-and-Play","slug":"35c3-1352-session_film_stare_into_the_lights_my_pretties","title":"Film -- Stare into the lights my pretties","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"","language":"","abstract":"","description":"","persons":[],"links":["https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Film_--_Stare_into_the_lights_my_pretties"]},{"id":1322,"guid":"5664514a-e1e8-461f-8187-422a73a875e8","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T12:00:00+01:00","start":"12:00","duration":"1:00","room":"ChaosFilmSociety Art-and-Play","slug":"35c3-1322-session_game_over","title":"Game over","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"workshop","language":"","abstract":"","description":"","persons":[],"links":["http://www.kulturersatz.de/","https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Game_over"]},{"id":1324,"guid":"6483ae1a-1c78-4415-a68a-d472d540d6eb","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T15:00:00+01:00","start":"15:00","duration":"1:00","room":"ChaosFilmSociety Art-and-Play","slug":"35c3-1324-session_get_out_of_your_bubble_","title":"Get out of your Bubble!","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"","language":"","abstract":"","description":"","persons":[],"links":["http://www.manifestations.nl","https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Get_out_of_your_Bubble!"]}],"Assembly:WikiPakaWG":[{"id":1353,"guid":"c109dfc7-b709-4a95-aaff-d021aa43c47c","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-28T13:00:00+01:00","start":"13:00","duration":"1:00","room":"Assembly:WikiPakaWG","slug":"35c3-1353-session_fragdenstaat_user_treffen","title":"FragDenStaat-User-Treffen","subtitle":"","track":"self organized sessions","type":"","language":"de","abstract":"","description":"Alle Leute, die FragDenStaat und Informationsfreiheitsgesetze bereits nutzen oder nutzen wollen, sind herzlich eingeladen.

Dabei sollen sowohl Grundlagen wie Wahrscheinlichkeiten, verschiedene statistische Testverfahren und Metaanlysen als auch Probleme wie p-Hacking und die Replikationskrise angesprochen werden. Ziel des Vortrags ist es, den Zuhörer*innen einen Eindruck davon zu vermitteln, was empirische Studien aussagen können und was nicht.

Der Uplink kann durch Störsender, Repeater und viele andere HF-Quellen gestört werden. Wenn er gestört ist, ist die mobile Kommunikation eingeschränkt. Ich werde zeigen, welche Arten von Störquellen den Uplink stören können und welche Auswirkungen das auf die Nutzung des Mobilfunks hat und wie Interference Hunting durchgeführt werden kann.\r\n\r\nZunächst erläutere ich die notwendige Pegelsymmetrie des Downlinks (von der Mobilfunk-Basisstation - eNodeB zum Endgerät) und dem Uplink (vom Endgerät zurück zur eNodeB). Da die Sendeleistungen von Endgerät und eNodeB sehr unterschiedlich sind, erkläre ich technische Hintergründe zum Erreichen der Symmetrie. Im Folgenden werde ich die Probleme und Möglichkeiten bei der Messung von Uplink-Signalen am eNodeB erläutern, in Empfänger kann man ja schlecht hineinschauen. Der Downlink ist im Vergleich dazu sehr einfach zu messen, man sieht die Balken auf dem Smartphone oder kann APPs dazu nutzen, die detaillierte Feldstärkeinfos etc. liefern. Der Uplink bleibt allerdings weitgehend unsichtbar. Wenn dieser allerdings am eNodeB gestört ist, sagen die Feldstärkebalken am Endgerät gar nichts aus. Dazu werde ich eine Möglichkeit der Beobachtung vorstellen, die einige Endgeräte on Board mitbringen bzw. mit APPs aus dem Chipset herausgelesen werden können. In welcher Form der Uplink gestört werden kann, die Auswirkungen für die Kommunikation und das Suchen von Uplink-Störquellen werden den Vortrag abschließen. Dabei werde ich auch auf das Problem der 'passiven Intermodulation' (PIM), eine (nicht) neue Störquelle in den Bassisstations-Antennenanlagen, deren Bewertung, Messung und Vermeidung eingehen.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8197,"public_name":"Peter Schmidt"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9507.html","id":9507,"guid":"787007cf-828d-4409-94b0-90a0b8d727a0","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/009/507/large/IFG_angriff.jpg?1545231555","date":"2018-12-29T14:10:00+01:00","start":"14:10","duration":"01:00","room":"Adams","slug":"35c3-9507-best_of_informationsfreiheit","title":"Best of Informationsfreiheit","subtitle":"Transparenz mit der Brechstange","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Mit (u. a.): Rainer Rehak, Anna Biselli, Andre Meister, ...\r\n\r\nWas für die Breitbandversorgung in Deutschland gilt, gilt auch für Transparenz: Überall Demokratie-Funklöcher, die man stopfen muss, am besten mit Klagen.

Since time, when the “hole-in-the-wall” cash machine used radiocarbon paper cheques, ATMs became more complex and smart, providing opportunity to withdraw money without cards.

Migration from Windows XP to Windows 7/10 means there is always PowerShell on the ATM. “New” types of input devices allow BadBarcode-like attacks.

Because of the communication delay from Earth to Mars, it needs to accomplish most of its tasks completely autonomously: landing, navigation, exploration and singing birthday songs to itself.

The spacecraft only has one onboard computer that took over from the second it was launched towards Mars. It navigated the stars and orbits, managed a very complicated landing procedure, and now drives around as a car-sized rover over rocks and slippery ravines, all while collecting samples and analysing them with its on board lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First we'll have a look at the history of the Mars Science Laboratory plans, then in part two we will launch into hardware. What processors do we have, how are the working together? How is redundancy handled, and shielding against radiation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a part three, we'll look closely at the rover's software. Using over the air updates, almost all code running on Curiosity has been pushed there after it had landed on Mars. NASA pushed updates to enable new scientific missions, to make it traverse the environment in a different way, and to route around broken hardware. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After listening to this talk, you should find yourself inspired to look at problems of software and hardware fault-tolerance and  long-term maintenance in a new light.

We will describe the defenses and mitigations that it got right as well as insights into how we finally defeated it. The talk will be broken into two segments: software and hardware. First, we will give some background on the proprietary security co-processor we deem F00D, how it works, and what we had to do to reverse an architecture with minimal public information. Next, we will talk about hardware attacks on a real world secure hardware and detail the setup process and the attacks we were able to carry out. This talk assumes no prior knowledge in hardware and a basic background in system software. Focus will be on the methods and techniques we've developed along the way.","description":"How do you hack a device running a full featured, security hardened, and completely proprietary operating system executed on a custom designed SoC? Although the PlayStation Vita did not reach the market success of its contemporaries, it was a surprisingly solid device security-wise. Sony learned from the mistakes of PS3 and PSP and there were (mostly) no \"FAIL\" moments. It carried exploit mitigations that are standard today but groundbreaking for a \"popular\" device in 2012: SMAP, kernel ASLR, > 2 security domains, and more. Molecule was the first group to run unsigned code on the device as well as the first to hack kernel mode and TrustZone. However, to target the security co-processor (F00D), we need to bring out the big guns. Using a highly customized version of the popular ChipWhisperer hardware, we carried out hardware attacks on the device including fault injection (glitching) and side channel analysis. In a board with twelve layers, dozens of unknown ICs, and hundreds of passives, how do you even begin to attack it without any information? We will start with the basics: a whirlwind tour of the theory behind the attacks. Then we will move to the practical application: mapping out the power domains of a SoC, soldering tips for microscopic points, finding a good trigger signal, finding a glitch target, and searching the right parameters. Finally, if time permits, we will also talk a bit about how to extend our existing setup to perform side channel analysis with a few modifications.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the Vita was such a niche device, but we hope this talk will inspire more people to pick it up.

As a particle accelerator, it enables us to study proton collisions in large detector experiments such as ATLAS and CMS.

In a large fraction of these collisions, reactions take place that have been studied and understood for decades now. The very rare processes, however, are those that are especially interesting, but at the same time challenging to extract. \r\nThe probabilities of processes, that have been studied and confirmed so far, span a range of 14 orders of magnitude. Finding the needle in the haystack of events we record at the LHC is like trying to score a field goal in basketball from space.\r\nThe rareness of the interesting phenomena not only calls for pure physics understanding, but it also requires advanced techniques in data mining to find as many events of interest as possible while reducing the number of incorrectly accepted events.

A long-existing sub category of the internet of things is a mysterious area called teledildonics. This term got invented about 40 years ago and described (at this time fictional) devices, allowing their users to pleasure themselves, while being interconnected to a global network of plastic dongs. In the 21st century, teledildonics actually exist. Multiple devices are on the (multi-million dollar) market, offering the ability to pleasure an individual, while being connected to the internet. Those devices offer functionalities, like remote pleasuring over local links as well as over the internet. They implement social media-like functionalities such as friends lists, instant messaging, movie chats and explicit-image sharing. \r\nWith great pleasure comes great responsibility. A responsibility, which is not taken enough into consideration by the smart sex toy manufacturers as they should, while handling extremely sensitive data. As long as there is no serious breach, there is no problem, right?\r\nThis was the basis for a research project called “Internet of Dildos, a long way to a vibrant future”, dealing with the assessment of smart sex toys and identification of vulnerabilities in those products, including mobile apps, backends and the actual hardware. \r\nAfter the assessment of a selection of multiple smart sex toys an abyss of vulnerabilities was revealed. The identified vulnerabilities range from technically interesting vulnerabilities to vulnerabilities which affect the privacy of the users in extreme and explicit ways. It was possible to gain access to thousands of users’ data records, including cleartext passwords, explicit images, real-world names, real-world addresses, and many more specific facts. Furthermore, we were able to remotely pleasure individuals without their consent over the internet, or over a local link.\r\n\r\nPresentation Outline\r\n1.\tWhy?\r\nExplanation as to why it is necessary to conduct penetration tests in the area of teledildonics and why the topic was chosen for further research. \r\n\r\n2.\tQuick introduction into basics like\r\nInternet of Things (IoT)\r\nSextech\r\nTeledildonics (History of Smart Sex Toys)\r\nInternet of Dongs (IoD)\r\n\r\n3.\tThe “Test Devices”\r\nA quick introduction of the test devices examined during this project.\r\nExplanation of their feature set including areas of application and use-cases.\r\n\r\n4.\tLet’s get dirty – An overview of the identified vulnerabilities\r\nDS_STORE File Information Disclosure\r\nCustomer Database Credential Disclosure\r\nUnrestricted Access to administrative interfaces\r\nWeird authentication implementation\r\nUnauthenticated Bluetooth LE Connections\r\nMissing Authentication in Remote Control\r\nAnd many more…\r\n\r\n5.\tBluetooth LE Protocol exploitation\r\nBrief overview over Bluetooth LE security features\r\nBrief overview over Bluetooth LE authentication/pairing methods\r\nBrief overview over Bluetooth LE exploitation Hardware\r\nBrief overview over Bluetooth LE exploitation Software\r\nHands-on example\r\n\r\n6.\tThe “Swinger Club Problem”\r\nHow the manufacturers tried to downplay the vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n7.\tLegal Issues – Rape over the wire?\r\nHow are current laws dealing with sexual pleasure without consent over the internet?\r\n\r\n8.\tResponsible Disclosure Process\r\nCoordinated vulnerability remediation with the German CERT-Bund\r\n\r\n9.\tOngoing/Similar Research\r\n\r\nTakeaways\r\nAttendees are made aware that not a single category of devices in the internet of things is secure, no matter how obscure and outlandish the device might be. This should also raise attention and motivation to test all those devices that are already out there and handle the Internet of Things more cautiously.\r\nAnother important takeaway is to raise attention to how poorly programmed many IoT devices are and how it is still possible to discover vulnerability cases, which should be resolved and extinct. \r\nLast but not least, we want to take the opportunity to discuss and raise attention to the hot topic of “remote rape” or how our current legislature deals with remote pleasuring without consent.\r\n\r\nWhy this talk?\r\nFirst and foremost, this talk will be a lot of fun while teaching the audience how to assess smart sex toys and penetrate their backends (pun intended). The audience will learn what an attacker is capable of when attacking smart sex toys, nowadays. Furthermore, the audience will get deep insights into Bluetooth LE penetration testing including a hands-on example on a selected smart sex toy.\r\nMost of the identified vulnerabilities [1, 2, 3, 4] identified to this day include minor backend issues and or the good old exploitation of the Bluetooth LE protocol. The major difference compared to this research is, that the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab identified a potential massive breach of data, including explicit images, clear text passwords, etc) via the “publicly” accessible database, as well as the issue with the remote pleasuring without consent, which is a so called “Feature”.\r\n\r\n[1] https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/screwdriving-many-bluetooth-sex-toys-leave-users-vulnerable/\r\n[2] https://internetofdon.gs/reports/\r\n[3] https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/screwdriving-locating-and-exploiting-smart-adult-toys/\r\n[4] https://scubarda.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/hacking-a-bt-low-energy-ble-butt-plug/","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8352,"public_name":"Werner Schober"}],"links":[{"url":"https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/2018/02/internet-of-dildos-a-long-way-to-a-vibrant-future-from-iot-to-iod/index.html","title":"IoD Blogpost"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9941.html","id":9941,"guid":"ea00d1e0-a580-415f-a8cf-f02883d939dc","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/009/941/large/images.png?1539641148","date":"2018-12-29T23:50:00+01:00","start":"23:50","duration":"00:40","room":"Borg","slug":"35c3-9941-how_facebook_tracks_you_on_android","title":"How Facebook tracks you on Android","subtitle":"(even if you don’t have a Facebook account)","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"<p>In this talk, we’re looking at third party tracking on Android.

Von dem durch ein supermassives schwarzes Loch im Zentrum seiner Galaxie angetriebenen kosmischen Teilchenbeschleuniger fand eines dieser Teilchen seinen Weg zur Erde und interagierte mit Wassermolekülen im antarktischen Eis. Durch einen glücklichen Zufall konnte das IceCube Neutrino Observatory, ein Kubikkilometer großer Detektor aus instrumentiertem Eis, am 22. September 2017 eine Lichtspur aufzeichnen, die direkt zur Quelle zurück zeigte. Damit konnte erstmals ein bekanntes astrophysikalisches Objekt mit dem Ursprung eines kosmischen Neutrinos assoziert werden und das Ereignis IceCube-170922A schrieb Geschichte. Ein näherer Blick auf die während 2014-2015 gesammelten Daten zeigte, dass die Neutrino-Emission von TXS0506+056 phasenweise erhöht ist. Dies unterstützt die These, dass das Ereignis von 2017 tatsächlich dem Blazar zugeordnet werden kann und die Entdeckung wurde zu einem großer Erfolg für die Multi-Messenger Astrophysik. ","description":"Bereits 1912 entdeckte Viktor Hess die als kosmische Strahlen bekannten hochenergetischen Teilchen, die im Sekundentakt aus dem Weltall auf die Erdatmosphäre treffen. Einige von ihnen stammen aus unserer Sonne, andere von Quellen in unserer eigenen Galaxie – bei den höchsten Energien liegen die Ursprünge allerdings vermutlich in weit entfernten Galaxien. Unglücklicherweise handelt es sich größteils um geladene Ionen, die auf ihrem Weg durch das Universum durch Magnetfelder abgelenkt werden und nicht zu ihren Quellen zurückverfolgt werden können. Deswegen konnte in den mehr als 100 Jahren seit ihrer Entdeckung keine eindeutige Quelle extragalaktischer kosmischer Strahlen identifiziert werden.  \r\nTrotz allem gibt es dort draußen Objekte, die winzige Teilchen mit den unvorstellbar geringen Massen von 10^-24g auf die Energie beschleunigen, mit der Rafael Nadal seine Tennisbälle aufschlägt. In irgendeiner Form müssen diese Objekte strahlen und neben kosmischen Strahlen auch andere Teilchen emittieren. Hier setzt die Idee von Multi-Messenger Astroteilchenphysik an: Bei der Untersuchung der energiereichsten Objekte unseres Universums werden zugleich Licht, Neutrinos und Gravitationswellen betrachtet, allesamt ungeladene Boten, die Informationen von den Quellen direkt zu unseren Detektoren tragen. Während 2017 Gravtitationswellen eines Gammastrahlenblitzes identifiziert werden konnten, war der diesjährige Durchbruch in der Multi-Messenger Astroteilchenphysik die Assoziation eines von IceCube detektierten Neutrinos mit einem bekannten Blazar in einer weit entfernten Galaxie. \r\n\r\nIn diesem Vortrag erklären wir, was Menschen zum Bau komplexer Detektoren an den exotischsten Plätzen der Welt motiviert, um hochenergetische Teilchen aus dem Weltall zu jagen. Wir sprechen über die bahnbrechende Entdeckung diesen Jahres und beleuchten, wie der Durchbruch durch twitter-ähnliche Echtzeit-Monitoring-Systeme überhaupt erst möglich wurde.  \r\n\r\n5.7 billion years ago, the blazar TXS0506+056, a gigantic particle accelerator driven by the super-massive black hole at the center of its host galaxy, emitted a large number of weakly interacting elementary particles, known as neutrinos. One of these particles found its way to Earth and interacted with water molecules in the South-Antarctic Ice Sheet. Fortunately, the IceCube Observatory, a cubic kilometer of instrumented ice recorded a track of light that pointed directly back to its origin, unlike many other neutrinos captured in the past. This event, called IceCube-170922A writes history, since for the first time a concrete astrophysical object can be associated to the origin of this neutrino and thus the presence of strongly accelerated, interacting matter. A second look at the data recorded in 2014-2015 confirmed that the blazar has indeed periods of high-neutrino emission, strengthening the confidence in the 2017 event to be a real discovery and great success for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics.\r\n\r\nAs discovered by Victor Hess already in 1912, there are particles impinging the Earth’s atmosphere every couple of seconds called Cosmic Rays. Some of them are accelerated in the sun, others by sources in our galaxy but at the highest energies, these particles are very likely coming from distant galaxies. Unfortunately, most of them are charged ions that are deflected by magnetic fields on their way through the universe and they do not point back to the point where they have been accelerated. Therefore, even 100 years after the discovery of cosmic rays a definite and obvious source has not been discovered. However, there is something out there that can accelerate a tiny particle with a mass as little as 10-24g (this is a number with !23! decimal zeros) to the energy equivalent to a tennis ball served by Rafael Nadal, then it must somehow shine and emit other radiation among the Cosmic Rays. This is the basic idea of multi-messenger astrophysics that aims to study the most violent objects in the universe by looking simultaneously at the emitted light, the neutrinos and the gravitational waves, which are all uncharged messengers carrying the information from the sources directly to our detectors. While n 2017, gravitational waves from a Gamma-Ray Burst were identified, this years major breakthrough in the field of multi-messenger astrophysics was the association  of a high energy neutrino detected by IceCube with a known blazar in a far away galaxy.  \r\n\r\nIn this lecture, we will aim to explain what motivates mankind to build complex observatories at the most exotic location around the globe to haunt for very high energy particles from space. We will shed light on this brand new detection and highlight that without the recent developments in a real-time monitoring/Twitter-like system the detection would have gone unnoticed.\r\n\r\nImage / Video Credits \r\n\r\nTitelbild: NASA\r\nB2\tUni Wien\r\nB3\tNASA\r\nB4\tCERN / LHC\r\nB5\tAuger Collaboration\r\nB6\tSven Lafebre\r\nB7\tNASA\r\nB8\t A.

Technically, encryption is the go to protection mechanism; it may be implemented in software or hardware (or both). It can be applied on the level of individual files, or the entire drive, which is called full-disk encryption. Full-disk encryption is often the solution of choice as it takes away concerns of sensitive data leakage through, for example, temporary files, page files and caches. Several software solutions for full-disk encryption exist, and modern operating systems typically integrate it as a feature. However, purely software-based encryption has inherent weaknesses, such as the encryption key being present in RAM at all times and performance drawbacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an attempt to address these weaknesses, hardware full-disk encryption is often proposed; the encryption is performed within the drive itself, thereby confining the encryption key exclusively to the drive. Typically, the encryption itself is performed by a dedicated AES co-processor, whereas the software on the drive (firmware) takes care of the key management. It is often regarded as the successor of software full-disk encryption. Full-disk encryption software, including those integrated in modern operating systems, may autonomously decide to rely solely on hardware encryption in case it is supported by the storage device (via the TCG Opal standard). In case the decision is made to rely on hardware encryption, software encryption is disabled.

Die Mieter*innen sind zugleich Besitzer*innen ohne private Gewinnerzielungsabsichten, sie transferieren Knowhow und oft auch Direktkredite an andere Hausprojekte.","description":"In einer Zeit, in der Mieten teilweise die Hälfte des Einkommens verschlingen, wollen wir mit unserer Idee des Mietshäuser Syndikats (MHS) dagegenhalten. Jedes Haus eines MHS-Hausprojektes wird dabei Gemeineigentum, die aktuellen Mieter*innen sind damit auch ihre eigenen Vermieter*innen. Das MHS beruht auf drei Grundpfeilern: Die Gruppen müssen sich selbst organisieren, sie müssen in einen Solidarfonds zur Initialisierung weiterer Hausprojekte einzahlen, und sie dürfen \"ihr\" Haus nie mehr verkaufen. Die einzelnen Hausprojekte agieren wirtschaftlich eigenständig, der Dachverband (das MHS) hält jedoch Besitzanteile an allen Hausprojekten und hat damit ein Vetorecht bei Verkaufsabsichten. Solvente Hausprojekte fungieren zudem intern oft als Direktkreditgeber mit dem Ziel, die Abhängigkeit von kommerziellen Bankkrediten erheblich zu reduzieren bzw. sie langfristig komplett obsolet zu machen. Die Mieten werden nur soweit erhöht, dass die laufenden Kosten gedeckt werden können. So entstehen bezahlbare Wohnräume und Räume für soziale und politische Initiativen – auch in Städten, in denen Mieten mittlerweile unerschwinglich geworden sind.\r\n\r\nDerzeit gibt es 133 MHS-Hausprojekte, in Frankreich, Österreich und den Niederlanden entstehen nach modifiziertem Modell eigene Syndikate und es gibt weltweit Beratungsanfragen. Die Hausprojekte sind in ihrer Vielfalt sehr unterschiedlich, von reinen Wohn- bis hin zu reinen Gewerbehäusern ist alles vorhanden. Oft gibt es Räume für Veranstaltungen oder Treffen von sozialen Gruppen und politischen Initiativen. Das MHS beschränkt sich auf die Organisation von Hausprojekten, denkbar wären auch andere Syndikatsideen wie z.B. Ackerland- und Wagenburgsyndikate oder lokale Energieerzeugersyndikate.\r\n\r\nDie anschließende Diskussion beleuchtet Synergien von MHS und CCC, teils am Beispiel des CCC Freiburg, der seit einem Jahr seine Clubräume in einem solchen MHS-Hausprojekt hat und so zum MHS-Mitglied wurde. \r\nDas MHS benötigt wachstumsbedingt Unterstützung bei der Einrichtung von Tools für Kommunikation, Organisation und Entscheidungsfindung, aber auch bei neuen Partizipationsformen an (teils länder- und sprachübergreifenden) Projekten oder Veranstaltungen, bei denen nur noch ein Teil der Teilnehmer*innen vor Ort ist und die übrigen digital mitwirken. Die Hausprojekte profitieren von freier Kommunikation in digitalen Datennetzen, wie es beispielsweise reudnetz oder freifunk anbieten. Die regionalen CCC-Verbände wiederum finden bezahlbare Clubräume in den Hausprojekten. Eine Zusammenarbeit auf politischer Ebene könnte genutzt werden, um gemeinsamen Kampagnen mehr Durchschlagskraft zu geben.

Topics as such  “paradigms of creativity” under the title “New Materialism / Anthropocentrism / Posthumanism” will be presented with the goal to position and understand machine-assisted creative interfaces within the broader field of media art and painting traditions.","description":"The painting robot developed at the University of Konstanz in southwestern Germany is a pioneer project in this field and is presently the only one with a visual feedback system. Much more than just a printer capable of reproducing a flat image, the e-David creates unique works through the application of paint strokes that are irreproducible in terms of their colour blend and the materiality of their layering. The possibility of visual feedback brings up many questions within the contemporary discourse on deep learning, artificial intelligence and robotic creativity.\r\nThe Collaborating explored further possibilities to exploit the painting robot creatively, and reflected on ideas about the ways in which these could be implemented in the form of software and hardware. A number of questions of wider impact arose as the result of our collaboration: When and why would a semantic method of defining the object in the image be used? Is it an advantage or a disadvantage to paint semantic objects without having a pre-existing cognitive understanding of them? How could I use abstract forms, grammatical structures or mathematic models to achieve more complex surfaces? How would computer language be used to express the intentions of a composition? When and why would different painting styles be used?\r\nFurther, on a technical level, we had to take into consideration how different materials would react with one another. For example, how could different colours be mixed on the canvas or on the palette? How should the size of the brush be set, and when is it necessary to add glaze? We would have to develop a range of distinct, individual brushstrokes (controlling the velocity and the z-axis) whose characteristics are analogous to those made by human painters in the “real world”, in order to be able to pre-define when, in which order and for which tasks each stroke is to be used. In doing so, we are basically defining and categorizing singular parameters within a library of painterly “acts” and “perceptions”, in order to create a grammatical structure for the “language” of robotic painting.\r\nConstructing e-David has provided many challenges in the realms of engineering, robotics, computer graphics and computer vision. We discuss how we arrived at our current painting set up and highlight the strengths and weaknesses found so far, as well as plans for future extensions. On the robotics side, the main issue is working with machines designed for repetitive, precise tasks and applying them for approximate and dynamic processes. Supervision of a painting process using vision or other sensors is challenging, as well as finding methods to process the data in a meaningful way. Seemingly simple tools like brushes are highly complex in their behaviour and using them precisely is difficult. In the talk, we elaborate on current problems and what future plans are to deal with these issues.\r\n","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8722,"public_name":"Liat_Grayver"}],"links":[{"url":"https://www.liatgrayver.com/robotic-painting","title":"Breaststrokes at the digital age"},{"url":"https://www.liatgrayver.com/robotic-painting-1","title":"Robotic Paintings"},{"url":"https://www.liatgrayver.com/traversing-the-threshold","title":"Traversing the Threshold"},{"url":"http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/eDavid/","title":"e-David.

","description":"The death rate at Europes seaborder reached a historical record this year: One out of five people, who left wartorn libya on flimsy boats, bound for Europe, drowned in September 2018. The main reason for the increasing death rate ist the crackdown on sea rescue by European authorithies. Back in 2015 and 2016, when rescue NGOs took up rescue efforts on the deadliest waters of the world, the Italian Coast Guard, the NGOS and even the European Navy worked hand in hand, to save as many lives as possible. Nowadays European authorithies are trying to turn the central med into a blackbox: As they rather want to watch people drown then to see them arrive at Europes shores, and barely any information on distress cases is passed to competent rescue workers, the hope of those trying to escape torture, slavery hunger and other forms of violence soleyly lies on the efforts of the civil rescue fleet. \r\n\r\nSince no rescue coordination center clearly takes responsibility in favor of those in distress, the technical means of communication and such to increase the search capacity or to document incidents at sea, used on the aerial and nautical assets of the civil rescue fleet, do play a key role in the efforts to coordinate rescues d.i.y. \r\n\r\nIn the future, a civil society run maritime rescue coordination center could help to significantly reduce the death rate at sea.

Therefore, we demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness using a very cheap self-made testbed (using alumium foil) to protect standard hardware against invasive attacks, such as needle probing through the case. ","description":"Cyber-physical systems are ubiquitous and are often located in non-trustworthy environments, in which data is processed that is both sensitive and worth protecting. Despite employed protection, measures such as secured communication an extraction of data and/or manipulation of it are often easily feasible if physical access to the components of the system is given. Or with the words of Brian Gladman: “It is relatively easy to build an encryption system that is secure if it is working as intended and is used correctly but it is still very hard to build a system that does not compromise its security in situations in which it is either misused or one or more of its sub-components fails (or is ’encouraged’ to misbehave) ... this is now the only area where the closed world is still a long way ahead of the open world and the many failures we see in commercial cryptographic systems provide some evidence for this.”\r\nOur technology is aiming to verify the integrity of such systems in order to detect attempts of an attack and activate appropriate countermeasures. The propagation behaviour of electromagnetic waves allows for an extension of the protection from individual small components to the entire periphery of a system (or even object). This allows detecting attacks, like spudding/drilling into cash terminals. \r\nBy deriving cryptographic key material based on physical disorder and unclonable complexity of an environment, it is possible to create a protection, which protects secret information without an attack-detection or data-deletion circuit. Due to its generic nature it is possible to flexibly use this protection concerning size and application. \r\n","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8459,"public_name":"Christian Zenger"},{"id":8493,"public_name":"David Holin"},{"id":8539,"public_name":"Lars Steinschulte"}],"links":[{"url":"http://news.rub.de/vermischtes/2018-10-11-it-sicherheitspreis-die-besten-innovationen-kommen-aus-bochum","title":"[1]"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9603.html","id":9603,"guid":"5b7f01a6-f762-4c28-961c-7f6ab2f70fb4","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-29T17:30:00+01:00","start":"17:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Eliza","slug":"35c3-9603-sneaking_in_network_security","title":"Sneaking In Network Security","subtitle":"Enforcing strong network segmentation, without anyone noticing","track":"Security","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Highly compartmentalized network segmentation is a long-held goal of most blue teams, but it's notoriously hard to deploy once a system has already been built.

An assemblage of semi-improvised visuals and composition experiments in web environments. The screen becomes an open stage for the hybrid code which links choreography and web programming as well as body and language.","description":"For the series ‘WebPage Act I, II, III’, Joana Chicau created a specific grammar or vocabulary that links choreographic concepts from post-modern dance with web-coding functions. \r\nThis technique follows the concept of esoteric programming languages, also called esolang, used when writing so ware, integrating a new grammar into an existing one. Although an esolang doesn’t have a proper functionality, it is used in combination with other programming languages to explore alternative ways of composing and writing code. Chicau started using esoteric programming languages as an a empt to overcome the abstractness of algorithmic code, and simultaneously as a way to develop my own design language, which derives from choreographic concepts. \r\nThe performance starts with a standard webpage, followed by the opening of the web console. The screen is now divided in two stages: the ‘frontstage’, the interface a user normally accesses and the ‘backstage’ or the web console in which programming languages can be ran. In the web console Chicau is calling, juxtaposing and manipulating different functions from a glossary of code, while simultaneously displaying the varied outcomes of graphic elements in the screen. These functions are named a er choreographic concepts, which are assigned to specific web actions. While the computer interprets the code, the audience will be interpreting and start wondering about the relation between the ‘choreographic vocabulary’ within the code and its immediate outcome.\r\nThe screen becomes an open stage, providing the audience the access to the methodology and the tools used during the performance. The performative aspect of the act of coding is a way to make more transparent the process of composition and to enhance the nuances and transient character of coding. \r\nAs in choreography, web-design also deals with space, time and movement qualities. It has been defining ways of moving, collectively or individually, through fluid nonetheless complex landscapes of information displays, networked spaces, and multi- media environments. The performance being presented and the notion of ‘choreographic coding’ is a technical as much as social, cultural and aesthetic experiment constantly being expanded.\r\nProgram Code\r\nThe flexibility of code allows for a combination of possibilities, not only for the live performance se ing, but also for the use of the code itself by other designers, just as in any choreography that can be re-interpreted, re-created and adapted.

But what if there was an unseen method of disruption to these powers? What can we learn from the blind and their increased awareness of sound and vibration to disrupt and circumvent these powers without detection?","description":"As we move towards immersive computing (XR) being the primary means of human-computer interaction, are we thinking of the blind and visually impaired? To this date, the simple answer to that question is no. However, through the visual innovations of VR HMDs, we have seen a strong momentum build for improved sonic and tactile computer interfaces. In my project Infinite Observer, I am working directly with blind innovators and content creators to set standards for UX in VR, and to empower the next generation of computing to support accessibility for the blind and visually impaired.\r\n\r\nInfinite Observer is the first narrative VR experience designed from the ground up by the blind for the blind. The experience places you in an underground ring of blind hackers called the Infinite Observers. As you discover throughout the experience, the group is filled with members of unique sensory skill sets and a deep understanding of the vibratory qualities that make sound so powerful. They monitor movements using echolocation and build resonant frequency-based weaponry. They can shift tectonic plates, teleport using molecular vibration, and hack into digital communication via sub-frequencies undetectable to the typical human ear. And you (as the user)…your purpose is to learn these skills and secretly take them to the AG to subvert the present, corrupted visual culture. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the experience is to empower its users, and create a heightened appreciation for the hidden powers of the senses beyond sight. It is also meant to instill clarity around the dominance of the visual in modern culture, and inspire ways to circumvent this. As hackers, I would hope for a discussion surrounding possible techniques that might be used by the Infinite Observers, and how sound/vibration can facilitate either increased privacy/anonimity or direct disruption of dominant visual media in the real world.

This session shows how co-operatively owned, non-hierarchically built Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) provides a more sustainable, and equitable, solution.","description":"Capitalist and consumerist structures have led to reduced incentives to make the most efficient use of food. Wastage is massive and the reasons are many: misshapen vegetables, damaged packaging, mislabeling, forecasting errors, unsold items, etc. These are all symptoms of the structure of our industrialised food production structures, food waste is inherent in these systems.\r\n\r\nMany organisations have sprung up to try and access this food, using many approaches. France has tried to outlaw supermarket food waste, apps like Olio and Too Good To Go try and use the startup/funding approach, charities like FareShare in the UK receive massive government funding to redistribute to other charities. Startups and big charities replicate the hierarchical structures and bureaucratic processes of capitalist organisations. Whilst they can achieve much at times, we don't believe this is the sustainable resilient model - profit motives or government objectives dictate the approach to take.\r\n\r\nIn Germany <a href=\"https://foodsharing.de\">foodsharing.de</a> was created as a grassroots volunteer movement with origins in the dumpster diving scene. It has scaled up to co-ordinate the activities of 30k food savers to collect leftovers from supermarkets. This was achieved with almost no external funding. It faced its own organisational scaling issues and expanding beyond German speaking regions has not been possible. In response to this, and working together, we created <a href=\"https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend\">Karrot</a> to try and alleviate some of these issues. Unlike in foodsharing.de we develop the software independently from any specific group, this has allowed us to build common software to be used across 6 countries by independent groups. We empower local groups with access to high quality software but otherwise leave them to organise themselves.\r\n\r\nWe believe that for solving a problem you cannot use the very practices that produce it in the first place: Hierarchies lead to passive individuals who wait for their leader's decisions and don't dare to get active on their own accord. For-profit organisations need to make money and will always prioritize this goal. We are not just here to save food, but want to support and encourage self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. This brings us inline with the wider co-operative and solidarity economics movement. To reject the capitalist structures that cause the problem in the first place.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not always easy...","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8307,"public_name":"Tilmann Becker"},{"id":8654,"public_name":"Nick sellen"},{"id":8661,"public_name":"Janina Abels"}],"links":[{"url":"https://foodsaving.world","title":"foodsaving.world"},{"url":"https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend","title":"Karrot"},{"url":"https://foodsharing.de","title":"foodsharing.de"},{"url":"https://community.foodsaving.world","title":"Foodsaving Community Forum"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLWccmvhIlU","title":"Presentation from the beginning of the project (2016)"}],"attachments":[{"url":"/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/003/708/original/presentation.pdf?1546106349","title":"Presentation"}]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9371.html","id":9371,"guid":"b87de377-eb03-4795-b998-7988a63fc239","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/009/371/large/Repair_Caf%C3%A9_-_Logo_generisch.png?1536821082","date":"2018-12-29T23:50:00+01:00","start":"23:50","duration":"00:40","room":"Eliza","slug":"35c3-9371-repair-cafes","title":"Repair-Cafés","subtitle":"… und warum ihr dabei mitmachen solltet","track":"Resilience","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Die Repaircafé-Bewegung rollt über unser Land herein.

In each of these scenarios, a victim's communication can be monitored and modified at a total loss of privacy.

This can be the address of the victim's computer or that of the router. I will show you how the possibilities of attacking in both directions.\r\n \r\nDNS Hijacking is a technique to monitor or modify the victim's queries on the Internet Domain System. Even when using encrypted protocols like HTTPS, privacy is at risk. With this scenario, you can apply a number of attacks I will present. \r\n\r\nRogue Access Points on a wireless network are harmful on another layer than previously inspected.

Eine Inhaltsanalyse mit anschliessender experimenteller Befragung. Was können Chatbots heutzutage und können sie Kunden genauso zufriedenstellen wie ein menschlicher Mitarbeiter?","description":"Chatbots im Kundenservice sind heutzutage nichts mehr aussergewöhnliches. Unternehmen wie ebay, zalando oder H&M setzen für die Beratung ihrer Kunden virtuelle Agenten ein. Chatbots können Kunden 24/7 bedienen, sind billiger im Unterhalt als ein menschlicher Mitarbeiter und nie unfreundlich. Jedoch stellt sich für Unternehmen auch die Frage, ob die virtuellen Berater die Kunden genauso zufrieden stellen können wie ein menschlicher Mitarbeiter. Schliesslich kann es zu technischen Fehlern oder auch zu einem Unverständnis der Eingabe des Kunden seitens des Chatbots kommen. Ausserdem fühlen sich manche Menschen unwohl im Umgang mit einem im Real life nicht existierenden Gesprächspartner. Viele Kunden sind auch der Überzeugung, dass sie mit einer solchen Künstlichen Intelligenz nichts zu tun haben wollen oder Chatbots technisch noch lang nicht so weit sind, um einen guten Service zu leisten.\r\nIn meiner Masterarbeit bin ich genau diesem Thema nachgegangen (zusammen mit meiner Kollegin, die leider nicht am CCC dabei sein kann) und will es nun auf dem CCC vorstellen. Zunächst werde ich vorstellen, wie sich der heutige State of Art der existierenden Service-Chatbots gliedert und welche Fähigkeiten diese besitzen. Zeigen sie Gefühle oder sind sie eher neutral? Sind sie gut darin, meine Wünsche zu berücksichtigen? Welche Umgangsformen herrschen? All dies wurde in einer Inhaltsanalyse erforscht.\r\nDanach möchte ich vorstellen, wie Menschen darauf reagieren, wenn sie von einem Chatbots oder einem Mensch über Chat bedient werden. Dazu wurde aus dem Material der Inhaltsanaylse ein Stimulus geschaffen, mit dem getestet wurde, wie Kunden auf einen Chatbot im Vergleich zu einem menschlichen Mitarbeiter reagieren. Es wurde eine experimentelle Befragung mit ca. 200 Teilnehmern durchgeführt, wo ihnen ein Kundengespräch mit Chatbots oder menschlichen Mitarbeitern vorgeführt wurde. Daraufhin bewerteten die Kunden das Gespräch auf die Qualität hin.\r\nEs kam heraus, dass es keinen Unterschied macht, ob man von einem Mensch oder einem Chatbot bedient wird, Hauptsache, der Chatpartner leistet eine hohe Beratungsqualität. Dies bedeutet, dass man Chatbots im Service-Bereich durchaus einsetzen kann, jedoch darauf achten muss, dass diese ihre Aufgabe gut erledigen.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":52,"name":"Silia Nebelstreif","biography":"Ich studiere Kommunikationswissenschaften und Biologie an der Universität Zürich, und bin zum 4.

Maurizio exploits these contrasts, wearing pinstripes or pyjamas or both - he jams.\r\n\r\nWe are talking about psychedelic house here. Socks off and sensual. It works on the big stage, it works in the club and it washes all over an after hour. This sound did not happen by accident.\r\nIn 1990 scrambling around some old Thorens decks in a club his mother worked in Maurizio was scooping up all the vinyl lost from the night before – the first Schmitz mixtapes (which actually were not mixed) saw the light of day at this time. Many were to follow and these valuable suckers live amongst 11,000 pieces of vinyl collected and stroked over the years.\r\n\r\nWhen German techno was dynamite, changing the rules and ushering in a whole new world of electronic music Maurizio was not only there – he was smack in the middle of it.\r\n\r\nBonn, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Munich. From the infamous “Labor” club to a 10 years residency at 'FrequenzBerater' to Frankfurt and “U60311”. Many many more but maybe two things stand out and tell you more. Spaldingstreet 43 in Hamburg, the original flat sharing rave. Maurizio presided over 7 years of lovely madness. Today you could create a major art/music festival just from the people who crashed out on the sofas there. Then the tour de force. His very own Mauromusica night founded in Bonn 2004 in the beautiful “Rheingarten”. An octagon shaped glass pavilion. Promoter, resident DJ and mum on the door. Another 10 years.\r\n\r\nNo need to name names, somewhere in the above paragraph they all passed through.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one name, because here comes the other Maurizio Schmitz.\r\nIn a 1994 after hour set in Munich, “Pulvertum” it was called, the raver Maurizio noticed Sven Vath 2 metres high in a tree mid set.

But he'd rather not talk about himself. \"The least important thing in all I do is myself,\" he says. \"It's about the music.\"","description":"But of course there would be no music -- no epic anthems like \"Hale Bopp\" nor transcendent tunes like \"Electric Friends\" without his creativity, vision, and technical virtuosity which has been honed by his lifelong fascination with sound.\r\nThe son of musical parents, Andreas grew up immersed in music. He began to study the piano as a child but quickly tired of rigid instruction. He stopped taking lessons and instead played along to records by The Beatles and Pink Floyd, \"trying to understand how they made the songs.\"\r\nHis main love, though, was electronics and physics. \"I never thought I'd be a musician,\" he says with a chuckle. \"I was the boy who built my own circuits, my own AM radio.\"\r\nThis fascination with electronics helped spark his love for pioneering synth bands like Devo, Human League and Heaven 17. When a friend lent him a synthesizer, Andreas and his brother set it up in their basement, along with a drum machine and organ, and proceeded to \"make a lot of noise.\" He was studying physics at the time but music absorbed more and more of his energy.\r\nIn the early 90s he and a friend opened a \"freaky punk New Wave\" studio. Suddenly, being a professional musician or recording engineer seemed realistic. About the same time another life-changing experience occurred: Andreas started going to techno parties.\r\nFor the first time, he saw his two great loves, music and technology, wedded to create something unique. \"It was music without a standard arrangement, music without vocals,\" he explains. \"Our New Wave and EBM projects always had a standard intro, bridge, verses, etc. Techno was totally new.\"\r\nWith typical fervour, Andreas dropped his other projects to concentrate on making a \"really cool techno record\". Much to the delight of electronic music fans, he has been doing so, with surpassing brilliance, ever since.\r\nThe marriage of Andreas's deep musical background and peerless technical skills birthed a unique sound that runs like a high-tensile wire through his prolific output as Der Dritte Raum. In the course of a dozen albums and almost thirty records and EPs, Andreas has never lost his fascination with pushing the boundaries of melody and technology.\r\n\"Commercial music has a very narrow horizon,\" he says. \" It is important for me to make music that can be played with other tracks without copying other ideas or sounds. It is dangerous to maintain a unique direction but that is the basic idea of making art.\"\r\nCurrently, the artist is at work on multiple projects, including polishing a new techno album for release later this year, playing with a live band, remastering old Der Dritte Raum material, and taking his music to the masses with his DJ/live performance partner Ralf Uhrlandt. As Der Dritte Raum live, Andreas and Ralf have been pushing the boundaries of electronica since the early '90s. They bring the studio to life onstage with an array of computers, synths, desks and effects. \"The equipment keeps evolving but it's always about jamming with sounds,\" says Andreas.\r\nHowever far-flung his gigs, or wide-ranging his ideas, Andreas is grounded by a simple truth: \"I love music. Not just electronic music. All music.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[],"links":[{"url":"https://soundcloud.com/derdritteraum","title":"https://soundcloud.com/derdritteraum"},{"url":"http://www.der-dritte-raum.de/","title":"http://www.der-dritte-raum.de/"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Lineup/events/10076.html","id":10076,"guid":"ba07707c-a984-4ac5-b6f7-b947a44245b2","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/010/076/large/31947322_1886358088061796_2297047130939850752_n.jpg?1545417368","date":"2018-12-30T02:00:00+01:00","start":"02:00","duration":"02:00","room":"Discodrama","slug":"35C3-ABFahrplan-10076-super_flu","title":"Super Flu","subtitle":"Progressive House","track":"Music","type":"djset","language":"en","abstract":"Willkommen in einer Welt, in der knusprig gebackene Bassdrums den Ton angeben; in der Momratzn zu zwickenden Hihats zucken und dir Sprechblasen sympathische Bässe zuwinken!

They’ve worked together on a variety of experimental and performative projects since 2001. Their latest project was recorded in late 2016, in Scandinavia, where they beautiful surroundings and solitude inspired them to record enough music for two albums. Rather than save some of the music for a followup album, a decision was made to release two albums simultaneously.","description":"Both Nikolai von Sallwitz and Alsen Rau are experienced musicians, who have enjoyed lengthy and successful careers. They’ve both previously worked together, and have also worked with a variety of different artists in a variety of roles.\r\nIn the case of sound architect Nikolai von Sallwitz he was mastered Scheich In China first two albums and has written for the Karachi Files’ 2016 debut eponymous album and Scheich In China. However, Nikolai von Sallwitz is best known as known as Taprikk Sweezee, which is the moniker he has been using since 2006.\r\nSince then, Taprikk Sweezee has worked in a variety of capacities, ranging from singer and songwriter, to recordist remixer and producer. His career as Taprikk Sweezee started in 2006 as a vocalist and since then, he has served what is akin to a musical apprentice. That is only part of the Taprikk Sweezee story.\r\nTaprikk Sweezee has written music and has been involved with sound design for film, theatre and a variety of art and pop projects. Somehow, Taprikk Sweezee has found time to collaborate with a number of visual artists, including Chris Hoffmann, Andreas Nicholas Fischer and Robert Seidel. There are it seems, many strings to Taprikk Sweezee’s bow.\r\nIn 2010, Taprikk Sweezee released his debut EP Conversea. A year later, and Taprikk Sweezee returned with his sophomore EP Poly. Taprikk Sweezee also finds time to work on projects with his friend Alsen Rau, including on the Barabass, Scheich in China and their most recent project Esmark.\r\nJust like Nikolai von Sallwitz, Alsen Rau has a wealth of musical experience. Over the years, he has been a member of various groups including Barabass, who released an EP in 2006. On + Brr followed in 2010, who released their debut album Peace and Love in 2010. This was followed by a quartet of singles. Alsen Rau’s next project was Scheich in China, who have released five albums between 2014 and 2016. However, this is just part of the story of Alsen Rau.\r\nHe’s also one of the founders and curators of Kraniche, a Hamburg-based club, that is renowned for exhibitions of experimental art. They’ve received praise and plaudits from critics and cultural commentators. There’s also been performances of experimental music at Kraniche, which has gained a reputation as a place that is\r\n  \r\nunafraid to showcase ambitious and inventive music. Away from Kraniche, Alsen Rau has also curated a number of exhibitions, performances and readings, and is heavily involved with city’s art scene. However, much of Alsen Rau’s time is spent making music.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[],"links":[{"url":"http://www.bureau-b.com/esmark.php","title":"http://www.bureau-b.com/esmark.php"},{"url":"https://e-s-m-a-r-k.tumblr.com","title":"https://e-s-m-a-r-k.tumblr.com"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Lineup/events/10056.html","id":10056,"guid":"c1d78229-225b-44fd-a087-b6acd77601c0","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/010/056/large/avatars-000118314231-989ats-t500x500.jpg?1545419962","date":"2018-12-29T21:00:00+01:00","start":"21:00","duration":"02:00","room":"Compeiler","slug":"35C3-ABFahrplan-10056-electric_kool_aid","title":" Electric Kool Aid","subtitle":"Deeptech","track":"Music","type":"djset","language":"en","abstract":"Electric Kool Aid is the atmospheric deeptech outfit of label head, studiogeek and dj extraordinaire Peer Schmid.","description":"Looking back on an intimate personal relationship with more than fifteen years of electrosonic art, Peer has been able to make himself a name – both as an artist and a remixer, with a great hand for unique and diverse atmospheres - as well as a witty producer, with the ability to capture and further refine the magic studio moment.

Shortly afterwards, a group of school friends, including rappers Thiat and Kilifeu, set up ‘Y’en a marre’ (‘We Are Fed Up’). Filmmaker Rama Thiaw soon came on board to start documenting events (meetings, campaigns, arrests, concerts, states of exhaustion, trips) from an insider’s perspective. This documentary is the second volume of Rama Thiaw’s trilogy of documentaries, where she highlights the relationship between politics and culture. It started with ‘Boul Fallé, the Way of Struggle’ shot in 2009, and the third volume of this trilogy will follow 6 reggae musicians in different countries. ‘The Revolution Won’t Be Televised’ was presented at the 2016 Berlinale and won the Prize of Critics from ‘FIPRESCI’ in the Forum category and a mention from Caligari Filmpreis.

When we started playing they were casual games to improve our skill set every now and then on weekends with a bunch of friends. In recent years, the CTF community grew much bigger and nowadays you can play a CTF every weekend if you want to. So what is it all about?\r\n\r\nFor the past 7 years, we organized the C3 CTF with a variety of challenges that try to be oriented towards real-world scenarios. The range of topics include reverse engineering, crypto(graphy) and web, and of course good old binary exploitation. If you solve a task, you get a flag. As simple as that. For the second time this year, we also run a separate, entry-level CTF designed for folks who do not like spending 48 hours on a single challenge. We are honored that over a thousand teams are playing with us every year from every corner of the world, and trolling our IRC channels.\r\n\r\nWe will present some challenges from this year's contest to give you an idea what you are up to when you decide to play. You will see how to solve our challenges even if you never played a CTF before.

Until recently, doing so may have required some significant setup involving a half-baked tracing kernel module, a custom kernel module, or even using a kernel debugger. This talk will introduce the eBPF functionality of the Linux kernel and cover practical uses of the technology beyond mere code profiling. We will show how eBPF can be used both defensively and offensively to protect, or compromise, a system.\r\n\r\nThis talk will primarily focus on using eBPF to dynamically instrument kernel functionality and gain deep insight on the workings of both kernel and userspace code across a running system. Attendees will leave with practical knowledge for using eBPF to (performantly) watch every action taken on a running system and make processes reveal their secrets.","description":"eBPF (or \"extended\" Berkeley Packet Filter) is a bytecode and virtual machine used as a safe computing environment within the Linux kernel to perform arbitrary programmatic actions. It is a redesign of the original BPF bytecode VM used, typically in userspace, to power features like tcpdump filters. eBPF has an entirely different set of capabilities and instructions, with its primary goal being to serve as a JIT-able virtual machine instruction set that can be targeted by compilers of a memory-safe \"restricted C\" language. In the Linux kernel BPF and eBPF have been applied to various different kernel features, from programmatic syscall filtering (for sandboxing) to performing efficient custom packet processing inline on the kernel's network data plane.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will first introduce and briefly discuss the internals of the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel, its features, and the current set of components that it may be integrated with. We will also briefly cover how eBPF does not intrinsically make C code secure and demonstrate how using eBPF instead of other, more mature, technologies may introduce vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe majority of this talk will focus on using eBPF to trace kernel functions to inspect both kernel and userland code and the data that flows through them. In line with this goal, this talk will cover pragmatic approaches to using eBPF and the non-idiomatic coding styles required to perform useful tasks in eBPF's sandbox. Additionally, while the aim of this talk is to cover the capabilities of \"vanilla\" eBPF, we will also demonstrate how the kernel may be trivially modified to lift the constraints of the eBPF sandbox when one does not have the time to tiptoe around the bytecode validator (or seeks to use eBPF as a drop-in replacement for kernel modules).\r\n\r\nLastly, this talk will show that while eBPF may generally be \"safe\" for the kernel itself, it is decidedly not when applied to userspace code. We will conclude this talk by demonstrating a general purpose privilege escalation technique that may be used by privileged users to hop namespacing and escape certain container configurations using nothing but eBPF.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":7551,"public_name":"Jeff Dileo"},{"id":8366,"public_name":"Andy Olsen"}],"links":[],"attachments":[{"url":"/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/003/729/original/Kernel_Tracing_With_eBPF.pdf?1546315681","title":"Slides"}]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9623.html","id":9623,"guid":"ba68f092-89bd-4348-9f81-7a05317a0497","logo":null,"date":"2018-12-30T14:10:00+01:00","start":"14:10","duration":"01:00","room":"Dijkstra","slug":"35c3-9623-augmented_reality_bridging_the_gap_between_the_physical_and_the_digital_world","title":"Augmented Reality: Bridging the gap between the physical and the digital world","subtitle":"","track":"Science","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"There has been a lot of talk about Virtual Reality (VR), but still there are very little applications to enhance our everyday lives outside of entertainment. Augmented Reality (AR), the less known sibling of VR, has the power to have a more profound impact on our lives than VR ever could. Instead of replacing the real world with a virtual one, AR enhances the reality with virtual content. Therefore, AR can be a gateway for people in accessing and understanding todays technology and could provide vast possibilities to support our everyday lives, e.g., for navigation, traveling, or education.\r\nThis talk will give an overview on AR in general and explain its possible benefits and use cases, as well as the issues that may arise, e.g., regarding privacy, data security, as well as psychological and sociological challenges. The talk requires no special knowledge and is suited for people with little exposure to AR and mixed reality, but it will also give insights into current relevant research and development.","description":"The recent renaissance and the technical advance brought Virtual Reality (VR) into the spotlight of the mainstream media and led to many promises of a upcoming VR revolution. But despite the abundance of VR headsets, the profund impact into our everyday lives is still not on the horizon. However, hidden in the shadows of VR, Augmented Reality (AR) has a much higher potential to change our lives. In contrast to VR, which aims to replace our physical reality with a virtual one, AR expands our physical world with virtual content. While VR disconnects us from the world, AR bridges the gap between the real and the digital world.\r\n\r\nResearch in last decades focused mostly on specialized and professional use, e.g., in medicine or the industry. Nonetheless, there are a lot of applications for everyday usage, like navigation, traveling, education, and others. Probably the most important promise of AR is that it can help mend the ever increasing breach between humans and technology. Todays technical systems are often to complex, processes to distributed for humans to fully understand the function and state of systems. With AR we can superimpose these information directly on our physical world, visualizing data flows and connections, and make technology understandable again.\r\n\r\nDespite these opportunities to improve our lives, AR also harbors possible dangers for our society. Looking at the development of the smartphone ecosystems, there will very likely be a few closed systems controlled by their respective globally operating manufacturer. The Microsoft HoloLens is an early example of this likely trend with supporting only  applications of windows universal platform. This implies the danger that these concerns have a vast control over the devices itself and with AR could literally dictate what we are allowed to see and what not. Privacy is also an important factor. To function in a satisfactory manner, AR headsets need a very good positional tracking and a video feed of what the user is currently seeing. To make sense of these informations, cloud-services will very likely be involved. This means sending what is basically a live feed of a persons live to somewhere in the vast expanse of the web. It's very hard to think of data that is any more sensitive than this. Therefore the challenge is how to make sure the data is handled responsibly and remains in the control of the user. Furthermore, AR can also be used for services, which are not in the best interest of the user, like personalized advertisements that, in a worst case scenario, could be superimposed on any surface. Last but not least, there are also some psychological and sociological challenges in the regard of how AR could influence our understanding of the world and how we interact which each other. This is an important question with our current use of smartphones, it becomes even more important when AR has entered our everyday lives.\r\n\r\nAll of this makes Augmented Reality one of the most interesting areas of the current technical development. Therefore, it is important to get an understanding of what it is all about, which is exactly the goal of this talk. Besides a short definition and overview of the historical context and the current state-of-the-art, the talk will introduce a possible scenario of how AR can influence our everyday lives, which is based on the raise of the smartphone to the ubiquitous device it is today. We will hopefully close with an interesting question and answer session, where we can discuss some aspects even further.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8081,"public_name":"preip"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]}],"Eliza":[{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9774.html","id":9774,"guid":"29febf04-4e28-4420-b159-d22634c6817e","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/009/774/large/9.jpg?1539613952","date":"2018-12-30T11:30:00+01:00","start":"11:30","duration":"00:40","room":"Eliza","slug":"35c3-9774-radical_digital_painting","title":"Radical Digital Painting","subtitle":"Fantastic Media Manipulation","track":"Art & Culture","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Radical Digital Painting groups and presents several ideas and artifacts related to contemporary painting and contextualizes its connection to historical processes and digital technology.

Few systems have been developed to explore the spontaneity and spirituality present in modernism and contemporary art and further develop the language of painting in general. \r\n\r\nJeffrey has created several programs that highlight abstract expressivity, play, and improvisation over production quality and technical control.\r\n\r\nIn addition to software demos, new theoretical models of image resolution, computer literacy, and picture making are illustrated, described, and connected to the history of abstraction in drawing and painting. New ways of approaching drawing are also presented. \r\n\r\nHe presently spends all his time traveling, performing, and continuing to develop his software and media performances.\r\n\r\nAs of Summer and Fall 2018 he is traveling and lecturing with the Danish composer Goodiepal and his band GP&PLS throughout Europe. Jeffrey’s work Ten Minute Painting is now a part of the International Goodiepal Collection at the SMK Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen, Denmark.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":8584,"public_name":"Jeffrey Alan Scudder"}],"links":[{"url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/170R26_4n3uQ_tlhGEWZZbsWssnwz6441ndqEQDSah2U/edit?usp=sharing","title":"Summary / Media"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9343.html","id":9343,"guid":"52ce1398-fa9b-4bd3-aa9e-6a49a764ac2c","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/009/343/large/logo-weiss.jpg?1536683965","date":"2018-12-30T12:30:00+01:00","start":"12:30","duration":"00:40","room":"Eliza","slug":"35c3-9343-court_in_the_akten","title":"Court in the Akten","subtitle":"OpenSchufa und OffeneGesetze","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Private Unternehmen müssen nicht so transparent sein wie Behörden - selbst wenn sie sich wie Behörden benehmen. \r\nWelche Mittel können wir nutzen, um trotzdem Lichts ins Dunkel der Konzerne zu bringen?

So existiert und floriert bis heute auch der Chaostreff Flensburg e.

Und wie kann man überhaupt ein Teil des großen Chaos werden, ohne überhaupt nur eine Seele dabei zu haben die weiß worum es geht? Und wie kann ich mein erstes kleines Event starten?\r\nDen nötigen Papierkram für Gründung, Beitritte und Versammlungen bringen wir euch natürlich zum Kopieren und benutzen mit.\r\nFreut euch auf eine humoristische Mischung aus gut gemeinter Inkompetenz und gemeinnützigen Papierschlachten.

It's a piece of electronics in a somewhat exotic environment. These days, hardware development has progressed to the point where off-the-shelf hardware can be used in space.  Improving performance, while cutting costs to a fraction. \r\n\r\nProfessional star trackers cost several hundred thousand dollars a piece. But it is just a simple camera and the necessary software to find and track star constellations. Consumer hardware, like CPUs and camera chips, is essentially space-rated by default. Silicon-on-insulator used to be special hardware for radiation environments, but is now used in consumer electronics. \r\n\r\nCheaper rockets became possible by pragmatic rocket engineering, notably by SpaceX but also Russian rockets still flying today. The ideas had been around for a long time. European, Chinese and Indian Launcher provide some examples on how to achieve reductions in launch cost and how not to achieve them.\r\n\r\nCheaper rockets in many cases also allow higher mass to be traded for lower prices. Larger margins reduce work for quality control and modular systems reuse old engineering hardware in new missions. Higher satellite mass become increasingly acceptable, if they reduce development and manufacturing cost.

At the tender age of 11, Ingo was already entranced by the new sound called techno that he had heard on the radio – two years later he already became acquainted with the wonderful things one can do with two decks and a mixer. As so many others, he was inspired by the music Sven Väth played at the legendary „Omen“ in Frankfurt where Ingo used to turn the night into day at the age of 15. In 1998 he had his first gig at the short-lived „U-Bahnstation Miquelallee“ in Frankfurt. In 2000, Ingo became a resident at a series of events called „Spectrum@MTW“, organized by the German music magazine GROOVE. That same year he published his first production „modes“ in cooperation with his studio partner Denis Engemann on PV Records and later on two mix CDs.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Ingo went on a tour which also led him abroad for the first time: with PV Records and with the Delirium Recordstore on the occasion of their 10 year anniversary. In 2002, he began his residency at the „U60311“ in Frankfurt and he held it until he gave it up in 2004 in favour of Cocoonclub. Ingo’s breakthrough as a producer came in the form of his EP „Transistor“, which was released on Cocoon Recordings in 2003 and which contained the goosebump track „Little Eternity“. The track made it onto Sven Väth’s mix CD „Sound of the Fourth Season“.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve 2004, Ingo made his debut at Cocoonclub where he played side by side with Sven Väth and 2Raumwohnung – he became a regular at Cocoonclub and pretty soon, he hosted the „micromized“ night with Chris Tietjen as co-host. In 2006, he and REBOOT made the successful remix of G-Man’s techno classic „Quo Vadis“. In november 2010, the industrious musician finally released his first album on TopModel Records. Ingo has been part of the Cocoon roster since 2009. In 2011 he launched his BEATPORT label called EUREKA Frankfurt. In February 2012 he released \"Same Mind\" - his second artist album - on Eureka. Later on followed by the „Same Mind Remixes“ abum incl. Remixes by Mark Reeve, Johannes Heil, Romano Alfieri, Dr. Shingo and many more artist.
